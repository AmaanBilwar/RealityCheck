  "article": "A federal judge ruled Saturday that President Donald Trump\u2019s firing of a federal workforce watchdog was illegal \u2014 teeing up a Supreme Court showdown over the president\u2019s claim to nearly absolute control of the executive branch.\n\nU.S. District Judge Amy Berman Jackson concluded that Hampton Dellinger \u2014 confirmed last year as head of the Office of Special Counsel \u2014 may continue to serve his five-year term despite Trump\u2019s effort to remove him from the post via a brusque email last month.\n\nA law on the books for more than four decades specifies that the special counsel can be removed only for \u201cinefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office,\u201d but the Justice Department argued that provision is unconstitutional because it impinges on the president\u2019s authority to control executive agencies.\n\nJackson ruled that Dellinger\u2019s duties, which include holding executive branch officials accountable for ethics breaches and fielding whistleblower complaints, were meant to be independent from the president, making the position a rare exception to the president\u2019s generally vast domain over the executive branch.\n\nDellinger\u2019s \u201cindependence is inextricably intertwined with the performance of his duties,\u201d Jackson wrote in a 67-page opinion. \u201cThe elimination of the restrictions on plaintiff\u2019s removal would be fatal to the defining and essential feature of the Office of Special Counsel as it was conceived by Congress and signed into law by the President: its independence. The Court concludes that they must stand.\u201d\n\nJustice Department attorneys contended Dellinger had significant power to act unilaterally, making it critical that he be under the control of the president, but Jackson said Trump\u2019s lawyers were exaggerating the special counsel\u2019s scope.",
