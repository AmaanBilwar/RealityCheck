Skeptics of modern media, however, often question the accuracy and objectivity of fact-checkers. The current study assessed agreement among two independent fact-checkers, The Washington Post and PolitiFact, regarding the false and misleading statements of then President Donald J. Trump. Differences in statement selection and deceptiveness scaling were investigated. The Washington Post checked PolitiFact fact-checks 77.4% of the time (22.6% selection disagreement). Moderate agreement was observed for deceptiveness scaling. Nearly complete agreement was observed for bottom-line attributed veracity. Additional cross-checking with other sources (Snopes, FactCheck.org ), original sources, and with fact-checking for the first 100 days of President Joe Biden\u2019s administration were inconsistent with potential ideology effects. Our evidence suggests fact-checking is a difficult enterprise, there is considerable variability between fact-checkers in the raw number of statements that are checked, and finally, selection and scaling account for apparent discrepancies among fact-checkers. Introduction\nFact-checking\u2014or the systematic assessment and publication of claims made by organizations or public figures to assess their validity [ 1 ]\u2014is a challenging task, with the goal of helping people separate fact from fiction. Consequently, professional checkers and fact-checking organizations perform a substantial public service by identifying information that is true and false across the globe [ 2 \u2013 5 ]. People, however, may question the credibility of fact-checkers for different reasons, including the perception that fact-checkers are biased, concerns around disinformation, or a general distrust in the media or institutions. A crucial question is: How do we know the fact-checkers are accurate? The answer is to check and compare the fact-checkers [ 6 , 7 ].\nComparing fact-checkers raises a host of issues. The first issue involves sampling or statement selection. The sampling frame for fact-checkers is large (e.g., selecting which statements to check), especially for a public figure such as an American president. There are many more checkable statements than can practically be checked. To cross-validate one fact-checker with another, we must first determine the extent to which they check the same statements, and why. If one organization identifies more false statements than another for a certain public figure, there can be at least two plausible explanations: (a) one organization might be checking more statements, or (b) the organizations might be selecting different statements to check. If fact-checkers do not focus on the same statements, cross-checking is not viable.\nA second key issue relates to a fact-checker\u2019s philosophy on what constitutes a false and misleading statement as well as the gradations of deceptiveness. When evaluating the same statement, apparent disagreements can occur for several reasons. Fact-checkers may overlook or misinterpret evidence or apply different standards for assessing the degree of truthfulness in a statement. Messages in the wild may not be categorically true or false, and statements that are literally true can also be misleading [ 8 \u2013 10 ]. When there is false content, it is typically mixed with truthful information [ 10 ]. Further still, honest messages are often \u201cpackaged\u201d\u2013they contain normative linguistic elements like politeness that are contextualized to make unpleasant truths palatable, thus creating a difference between acceptably honest statements and blunt truths [ 11 ]. Defining what is false and misleading is ambiguous, and organizations may differ in what counts as truthful, false, or misleading. This leads to our first research question:\nRQ 1 : How do major fact-checking organizations vary with regard to triggers for uncertainty about a statement\u2019s veracity?\nRelatedly, some fact-checkers scale the nature of false and misleading statements by providing a \u201cgrade\u201d for their deceptiveness. PolitiFact, for example, rates false statements on their Truth-O-Meter from true and mostly true to half true (e.g., a partially accurate statement with key omissions) to mostly false (e.g., a slightly truthful statement that removes critical facts), to false (e.g., an inaccurate statement), to pants on fire (e.g., an inaccurate and \u201cridiculous\u201d claim) [ 12 ]. The Washington Post Fact Checker, in contrast, scales false statements from 1 Pinocchio (e.g., a \u201cshading of the facts\u201d) to 4 Pinocchios (e.g., \u201cwhoppers\u201d). To further complicate the situation, differences in these scaling approaches may be less about definitions than scale sensitivity. In other words, one checker may be a harder grader than the other. The user takeaway from competing fact-checkers may not be the same and in the current work, we investigate the degree to which top fact-checkers are grading facts similarly.\nAgainst this backdrop, the current paper \u201cchecked the checkers\u201d by treating fact-checking sources like a media scholar might evaluate the accuracy of a coder in a content analysis [ 13 ], that is, by assessing fact-checkers for inter-coder agreement. We specifically compared statements by former President Donald J. Trump checked by The Washington Post [ 14 ] to the same statements checked by PolitiFact [ 15 ]. We also evaluated how other fact-checkers from non-journalistic outlets (i.e., Snopes, FactCheck.org ) compared in their assessment of statements fact-checked. We therefore evaluated the extent to which fact-checkers are checking the same statements and if cross-validation is possible. The ability to cross-check and, by implication, the ability of fact-check readers to trust results across multiple fact-checking organizations leads to our second research question:\nRQ 2 : To what degree do the scales used by different organizations yield similar interpretations of fact-checking results?\nThe role of fact-checking in political journalism\nFact-gathering and fact-checking are foundational to journalism and politics [ 16 , 17 ]. Journalists often advocate for and value fact-checking because it coincides with their professional values and offers a possible solution to public distrust in news and institutions [ 18 ]. Fact-checking is no longer optional for major, well-intentioned newsrooms and news organizations; it has become a central need and ethos for them in the wake of misinformation and propaganda, requiring journalists to make fast and accurate decisions about content veracity [ 19 ]. Citizens also believe fact-checking is crucial, especially for politicians [ 20 ]. Identifying the truth, and communicating it in a way that creates an informed public, are core parts of the journalism profession and are instrumental to a democracy [ 21 ]. Fact-checking is part of this process because it promotes accountability and attempts to ensure that people receive high-quality information from their leaders [ 22 ]. Additionally, to the extent that valid fact-checking is a time-consuming, effortful, and difficult task that benefits from professional training and experience, fact-checkers aid the public by making veracity assessments more accessible.\nThe critical issues evaluated in this work are how much two high profile fact-checkers observing U.S. politics\u2014 The Washington Post \u2019s Fact Checker and PolitiFact\u2014agree on what to fact-check and, when they do check the same facts, the degree of veracity agreement. Should two (or more) fact-checkers overwhelmingly agree on what is worth fact-checking and agree in their assessments of the factual accuracy, news consumers should have trust and confidence in a consistent set of facts from news providers to stay informed. Should there be considerable disagreement between fact-checkers on what to check, news consumers might question what they read, distrust news media, and consider fact-checkers to be partisan. They may also be left with doubts about what constitutes ground truth.\nWe note that prior work has taken a similar approach by evaluating statement selection from one presidency [ 7 ]. Nevertheless, there are outstanding questions to resolve. First, Lim [ 7 ] only evaluated President Trump\u2019s statements as a presidential candidate and those fact-checked by The Washington Post and PolitiFact between September 2013 and November 2016. Statements during the Trump presidency were unevaluated, and it is therefore unclear how fact-checkers might have selected statements to check as President Trump took office and his deception rate increased [ 23 ]. Second, the severity or grade of a false statement (e.g., 1 Pinocchio vs. 4 Pinocchios) likely matters for how people evaluate the truth. If fact-checkers show small-to-middling agreement on fact-checking deceptiveness, this might suggest scale sensitivity discrepancies or differences in how deception is conceptualized by sources. Finally, we evaluate if fact-checking selection disagreements are moderated by the political party in office. Our work considers fact-checked statements for President Trump while in office and compared the rate of selection disagreements to the first 100 days of President Biden\u2019s term. This helps ensure that our analysis is non-partisan and can generalize beyond a single administration. Fact-checking President Donald J. Trump\nHonesty matters to an electorate [ 24 , 25 ], and fact-checking is a key way to provide a report card for deceptive politicians. The interest in fact-checking presidents has increased over time, not only because it is seen as an innovation to journalism but also as an obligation of journalists [ 26 ]. Online access to technology and resources at scale, which began accelerating during the time of the Obama presidency, have amplified and accelerated the ability to record and verify information [ 6 ] and consequently, one of the most fact-checked public figure has been former President Trump [ 27 , 28 ]. Given the sheer number of Trump\u2019s falsehoods [ 23 ], because his approval ratings remained relatively flat as his falsehoods increased over time [ 29 ], and because his statements were consequential for the U.S. population, we evaluated how much fact-checkers agreed on their assessment of his statements. Empirically, President Trump\u2019s statements yielded a sample size larger than any other public figure in the U.S. or elsewhere, providing a unique opportunity to evaluate fact-checkers.\nFinally, we believe it is critical to evaluate statements in this manner because citizens should rely on fact-checkers to \u201cget it right,\u201d and report correctly and consistently on facts. If the news is not vetted properly or in a reliable manner, this can lead to the unchecked spread of fake news and disinformation. Most people are poor \u201cfake news\u201d detectors [ 30 ], suggesting Trump\u2019s repeated falsehoods may have subtly undermined the public\u2019s ability to discriminate truths from lies [ 31 ], or the public\u2019s trust that news organizations will present facts honestly. The public expects fact-checkers and news media to keep them informed about politics, which begins with a consistent set of facts. Truth-default theory: Fact-checking as deception detection?\nFact-checking and deception detection are not synonymous, but the overlap is considerable. According to most definitions of deception, false statements are not lies if the sender lacks deceptive intent [ 32 ]. A politician, for example, may believe what they say, even if it is patently false. In such cases, the statement is not a lie, but it could be fact-checked as false or misleading. Further, public figures may lie about non-factual matters (e.g., opinions that are not rooted in fact). Not all false and misleading statements can be rectified by fact-checking and the intersection between what can be documented as false and what is deceptive is imperfect. Nevertheless, the overlap between deception detection and fact-checking is substantial and consequently, theories of deception detection may inform fact-checking.\nMost deception detection research has investigated lie detection based on senders\u2019 specific and observable behaviors referred to as deception cues [ 33 , 34 ]. Decades of research on cue-based lie detection suggest that people are poor lie detectors (54% accuracy; [ 35 ]). In a finding called the \u201cveracity effect,\u201d people are consistently worse at identifying lies than truths [ 36 ]. Thus, the 54% accuracy result is correct truth-lie discrimination; but the probability of correctly identifying a lie, per se, is below 50% [ 35 ].\nTruth-default theory [ 32 , 37 ] provides important insights that are relevant to the current discussion, and we draw on TDT for much of our theoretical grounding. TDT is unique among theories of deception detection in its focus on communication content rather than cues, and in addition to fact-checking as a method of deception detection. Further, TDT\u2019s concept of triggers may also be useful in understanding journalistic fact-checking. Simply stated, a trigger is any stimulus that either prompts suspicion or skepticism, or that shifts a veracity assessment from under suspicion to considered deceptive.\nThe core idea of TDT is that of people defaulting to the truth. This proposition is rooted in the social need for efficient and effective communication. People tend to uncritically believe communication content unless skepticism is actively triggered [ 37 ]. Consequently, the public\u2019s vulnerability to deception is likely greater than deception detection research suggests because deception detection experiments prompt conscious truth-lie assessments that might not otherwise come to mind. Truth-default research shows, for example, that a communicator\u2019s identity as a well-known politician, for example, is not sufficient to trigger critical considerations of veracity [ 38 ]. Outside of the laboratory, the idea that some content might be false or misleading often does not register. Fact-checking can thus serve as a trigger for the public to assess veracity and honesty [ 32 ]. Interestingly, the trigger construct may also apply to fact checker\u2019s selections of what to fact check. Differential trigger sensitivity may offer a useful theoretical frame for understanding differences in selection criteria and choices.\nTruth-default theory prioritizes checking facts over behavioral cues and demeanor [ 32 , 37 ]. The theory values journalistic fact-checking because (a) checking facts is theoretically specified as the most preferred and efficacious method of deception detection, and (b) due to the truth-default, the public is unlikely to critically assess content in the absence of dedicated fact-checkers. People tend to believe that others are honest, most of the time. Evidence of the efficacy in fact-checking by identifying false and misleading statements would be consistent with the theory; robust inaccuracies would undercut a major assumption of the theory.\nPresently, most fact-checking is a human activity. Therefore, issues of how a fact-check is triggered, the ways in which it yields information to confirm or disconfirm the veracity of a statement, and its ability to be shared with many people rather than informing the judgment of a single individual are important consequences to applying the TDT propositions. Importantly, TDT states (regardless of who is doing the detecting), deception is most accurately detected, \u201cby comparison of the contextualized communication content to some external evidence or preexisting knowledge\u201d [ 37 ]. As this seems to be the essence of fact-checking, we therefore raise the third research question:\nRQ 3 : To what degree does truth-default theory apply to journalistic fact-checking? The current study\nIn the U.S., two of the most prominent media-based political fact-checkers are The Washington Post Fact Checker and PolitiFact. The present work draws on the perspective of truth-default theory to evaluate how much these fact-checkers agree in their assessment of facts. Here, we focus on how much overlap exists among statements that are checked by leading fact-checkers (i.e., the influence of human abilities). We also evaluate the strength of the association between scaling across The Washington Post Fact Checker and PolitiFact to assess if they frequently give the same or similar deceptiveness ratings. Finally, to broaden the scope of our investigation, we evaluated how often two non-journalistic sources (i.e., Snopes, FactCheck.org ) fact-checked the same statements as PolitiFact. Method\nData collection\nThe Washington Post Fact Checker\nThe Fact Checker is an ongoing feature that examines the truth of statements by political figures, ranging from local to international, and relies on reader input for topics to fact check. The database of Donald Trump\u2019s false and misleading statements from The Washington Post \u2019s Fact Checker ( N = 30,573 statements) was obtained from the database creators [ 23 ]. The database is a very large, although not complete, collection of statements. This project evolved from a post-election examination of Trump\u2019s public statements, to a comprehensive look at his first 100 days, to a daily tally until the end of his term. While The Washington Post generally relies on reader suggestions and tips regarding erroneous claims, the Fact Checker attempted to evaluate all topics and claims. Metadata in this archive included each false and misleading statement, the statement date and analysis, and a 4-point deceptiveness scaling (e.g., 1 to 4 Pinocchios). Importantly, only statements rated 2 to 4 Pinocchios were provided by The Washington Post . Statements judged to be true are not included (i.e., The Washington Post only reported on false or misleading statements), and Bottomless Pinocchios (e.g., repeated false or misleading statements) were not considered for this analysis to avoid redundancy. Overall, The Washington Post has the most extensive catalog of the former president\u2019s deceptive claims. PolitiFact and other fact-checkers\nWe collected fact-checked statements from PolitiFact ( N = 938) by locating Trump\u2019s scorecard and only considering statements made during his term in office. Each statement contained a range of data, including the 6-point deceptiveness scaling (e.g., true , mostly true , half true , mostly false , false , pants on fire ), the date of the statement, when it was fact-checked, and who fact-checked the statement. The large Fact Checker database provided the impetus for this analysis. But we used the PolitiFact data as the focal dataset because it contained true and false veracity ratings; The Washington Post has only false statements. Other fact-checkers are compared to PolitiFact.\nUnlike The Washington Post project, which monitored all of Trump\u2019s public statements and catalogued those which are unambiguously false, PolitiFact applied its usual selection process to Trump\u2019s statements. Typically, PolitiFact performs preliminary reviews of news stories, press releases, political speeches and advertising, campaign websites, and social media [ 12 ]. In addition, it accepts reader suggestions. PolitiFact then determines what to fact check using several criteria: Does it have a verifiable fact (they do not fact-check opinions)? Does it leave a misleading impression? Is it a significant statement (e.g., not an obvious misstatement)? And, is it likely to be passed on and repeated? Consequently, PolitiFact puts less emphasis on the quantity of Trump\u2019s deceptive statements and misinformation. Instead, its subjective focus is on those statements that are likely to be newsworthy and socially impactful.\nWe took a layered approach to evaluate how often statements fact-checked by other popular sources were cross-checked with PolitiFact. First, we evaluated only statements from The Washington Post that were also examined and classified by PolitiFact in the half true , mostly false , false , and pants on fire categories, since these statements were judged to contain explicit elements of deception (final sample, n = 513 statements during Trump\u2019s presidency). We could not cross-check true or mostly true statements by PolitiFact ( n = 64) because these statement types did not exist in The Washington Post database. To assess the possibility that the 64 true or mostly true PolitiFact statements might be differentially classified as false by The Washington Post , we also conducted a verbatim match (not requiring coding) against the 2 to 4 Pinocchio statements.\nTo further address this limitation, in a second analysis we selected a random sample of 100 statements across all six major PolitiFact deceptiveness categories ( true , mostly true , half true , mostly false , false , pants on fire ) and evaluated the selection correspondence with Snopes and FactCheck.org . These two sources are among the top non-journalistic fact-checkers and together, we evaluated how often PolitiFact statements are checked or unchecked by all three sources ( The Washington Post , Snopes, FactCheck.org ). While the criteria for moving forward with a fact-check are similar to those of PolitiFact, both Snopes and FactCheck.org have different approaches to the initial selection. Snopes covers a broader range of topics, not limited to politics, which are determined primarily by the strength of reader interest. FactCheck.org limits itself with regard to who gets checked (President Trump was within their focus), seeks claims of national significance, and typically ceases checking when a claim appears to be true. While claims by Trump have been fact-checked by all four organizations, the breadth of statements checked varies considerably and is determined by the objectives of the organization. Coding procedure\nCross-checking PolitiFact and The Washington Post\nTwo coders, the first and fourth authors, independently searched each PolitiFact statement to identify if they also appeared in The Washington Post \u2019s list (Since the number of statements in The Washington Post database was substantially larger than the number of statements in the PolitiFact database, we directed our search by identifying if PolitiFact statements were also found in The Washington Post , but not the reverse). Each coder relied on three criteria, in combination, to determine an appropriate match was made between sources: (1) a verbatim phrase correspondence (about two to five words), (2) date proximity (e.g., if the statements occurred on the exact date or were within three days of each other), and (3) topic similarity (e.g., the topic of each statement must be equivalent). In a few cases, verbatim matches were impossible due to subtle transcription differences between sources or if a single word indicated a false statement. For example, consider the PolitiFact fact-check, \u201cVideo shows California election workers \u2018cheating\u2019 by collecting ballots from drop box on Nov. 4,\u201d stated on November 11, 2020. Except for one word (\u201ccheating\u201d), the statement would not allow for a verbatim match because the rest of the statement mostly provided background or context to the fact-check. The statement still made a general reference to possible election cheating, however. In such cases, we ensured that the same topic was discussed across fact-checks and the date proximity of both statements were within three days. Variations in dates were typically due to factors such as the release date for transcripts or whether the source was primary (e.g., obtained from a tweet or live speech) or secondary (e.g., media reporting).\nCoders made a binary judgment (1 = yes, 0 = no) determining if a PolitiFact statement also appeared in The Washington Post \u2019s list. Raw agreement was substantial (476/513; 92.8%), and intercoder reliability, which adjusts for guess-rate or judgments being due to chance, was also strong (Krippendorff\u2019s \u03b1 = 0.797, bootstrapped 95% CI [.731, .863] using 5,000 replicates; see S1 File for more details). Coders resolved cross-checking discrepancies after discussion and re-performing the fact-checks together to ensure the right cross-check occurred. Please see the S1 File for examples of five representative and successful cross-checks across The Washington Post and PolitiFact. Note, since this coding procedure was a simple cross-checking task and did not involve thematic interpretation akin to qualitative coding, special coding software was not required. Please see the S1 File for a description of how deceptiveness ratings were aligned across sources. Cross-checking PolitiFact with Snopes and FactCheck.org\nThe first and second authors independently coded a random selection of 100 PolitiFact fact-checks and evaluated if the statement was also checked by Snopes or FactCheck.org . Coders entered a statement or keywords from the statement into the website\u2019s search bar and read relevant articles on each site to identify if a fact-check about the exact statement\u2019s topic or issue was made. Statements were placed into one of three categories: (1) Checked, and source (Snopes or FactCheck.org ) agrees with PolitiFact on veracity, (2) Not checked by source, or (3) Checked, but source disagrees with PolitiFact on veracity. This procedure occurred for Snopes and FactCheck.org , independently.\nInitial coding of these statements reached an acceptable percent agreement for Snopes (94% agreement) and FactCheck.org (82% agreement). Note, we did not compute traditional intercoder reliability statistics because the number of fact-check \u201chits\u201d (e.g., the number of times that a PolitiFact statement was also found on Snopes and FactCheck.org ) was low and the total number of reviewed statements was small as well, which would bias reliability calculations. Discrepancies were resolved after discussion and coders re-performing the fact-checks together.\nData are available from the authors or The Washington Post by contacting Glenn Kessler, maintainer of the Fact Checker ( Glenn.Kessler@washpost.com ). Results\nCross-checking selection agreement\nOur cross-checking revealed 22.6% of statements fact-checked by PolitiFact did not appear in The Washington Post database (116/513) (An exploratory thematic analysis using the Meaning Extraction Method [ 39 , 40 ] for the statements PolitiFact checked but The Washington Post did not is available in the S1 File ). As the top panel of Table 1 suggests, a range of 20\u201335% of the statements across the four deceptiveness rating categories used by PolitiFact were not checked by The Washington Post or were not included in the database of 2\u20134 Pinocchio statements. The verbatim check for true and mostly true statements found that only 1 out of 64 statements (1.6%) was given a false and misleading rating and included in The Washington Post selection, when PolitiFact tagged it as mostly true . This discrepancy is investigated further in the S1 File .\nTable 1.

The denominator in each cross-check agreement calculation is the PolitiFact value. For example, 64.7% of PolitiFact half true statements were also observed in The Washington Post database. For the cross-checking with Snopes and PolitiFact, two cases had the label as \u201cfull flop,\u201d which reflects a change in position on an issue, but not necessarily deception. Therefore, cases representing this category were excluded and the number of fact-checked statements for PolitiFact sums to 98, not 100. The cross-check agreement calculation in the bottom panel represents the percent of overlap with PolitiFact by at least one of the two sources (Snopes or FactCheck.org ). Here, Snopes and FactCheck.org results were summed in the numerator and PolitiFact results were the denominator. Our general pattern of results replicated prior work well [ 7 ]. We therefore attempted to confirm that the fact-checkers are consistent in their identification of false statements in other ways. Specifically, to provide an independent assessment of these data and further understand the difficulties involved with fact-checking, all four authors independently fact-checked a random selection of 10 statements previously fact-checked by both organizations. Each coder searched online sources for a claim\u2019s veracity without using The Washington Post Fact Checker, PolitiFact, or other published fact-checkers as sources. Coders made true , false , or uncertain ratings based on such evidence and coders also indicated the sources they used for veracity determinations. On 8 of the 10 statements, coders reached 100% agreement. The remaining 2 statements reached majority agreement (75%). In both cases, the fourth coder believed the statement was false, but felt the evidence was sufficiently ambiguous that a \u201cfalse\u201d rating could not be assigned. These data demonstrate that fact-checking is not easy, even for trained coders using clear guidelines. Poor grammar, conflating of ideas, obfuscation (intentional or not), conflicting source data for claims, and subjective interpretation of source data all contribute to the difficulty of ascertaining the veracity of a claim. Despite these challenges, our independent fact-check of the previously fact-checked statements validated the published results and therefore serves as an important robustness check.\nBeyond the Trump presidency\nOne concern with our analysis relates to the perceived liberal political bias that fact-checking organizations might have against a Republican president such as Donald Trump. To address this issue, all available fact-checks during President Biden\u2019s first 100 days were extracted from The Washington Post \u2019s Fact Checker ( n = 78). PolitiFact statements in the half true , mostly false , false , and pants on fire categories ( n = 11) were identified and an additional cross-checking process occurred. Only one coder (the lead author) reviewed these statements because the number of cross-checks was small.\nThe data revealed 6 out of 11 statements (54.5%) from the PolitiFact database were also observed in The Washington Post Fact Checker\u2019s list and the remainder (5/11) were not cross-checked. Note, this does not suggest one source rated them as true and the other did not, but instead, the statements did not meet The Washington Post \u2019s criteria for fact-checking or were missed. Consistent with the cross-checks for President Trump, there is a nontrivial degree of divergence across fact-checkers in what to check. We interpret these data with caution, however, since the number of fact-checked statements for Trump during his first 100 days [ 41 ], was substantially larger than for Biden. The same selection procedure and fact-checking team were used for the first 100 days of Trump and Biden. Cross-checking agreement with Snopes and FactCheck.org\nWe collected a random sample of 100 statements fact-checked by PolitiFact and identified if they were also checked by Snopes and FactCheck.org . This analysis helped to indicate if a subtle, yet unknown fact-checking bias existed for The Washington Post or if a similar rate of selection agreement/disagreement existed for other sources as well.\nOnly eight PolitiFact statements were also checked by Snopes and 21 PolitiFact statements were also checked by FactCheck.org . No disagreements in veracity were observed and all statements fact-checked by Snopes were also checked by FactCheck.org . The bottom panel of Table 1 reveals most statements checked by PolitiFact were not checked by Snopes or FactCheck.org . At most, 40% of statements from Snopes or FactCheck.org were also checked by PolitiFact. Taken together, the evidence collectively suggests more correspondence in statement selection between The Washington Post and PolitiFact compared to other sources and PolitiFact (All 8 PolitiFact statements checked by Snopes were also checked by The Washington Post and two-thirds of the statements (14/21) also checked by FactCheck.org were checked by The Washington Post ). The data further suggest that discrepancies are evident in what is fact-checked, but not in the bottom-line determinations of veracity (i.e., was the statement true or false?). When different fact-checkers check the same statement, they invariably agreed on the substance of the check. Deceptiveness scaling\nWe calculated a bivariate correlation between deceptiveness ratings for any statement with a Pinocchio rating from The Washington Post \u2019s Fact Checker and a Truth-O-Meter rating from PolitiFact. The relationship between these deceptiveness ratings was positive and statistically significant, r (107) = .451, p < .001. A non-parametric bivariate correlation was also consistent in magnitude and operated in the same direction, \u03c1 = .419, p < .001.\nIt is important to note that PolitiFact defines false as \u201cThe statement is not accurate\u201d and pants on fire as \u201cThe statement is not accurate and makes a ridiculous claim.\u201d Therefore, pants on fire is the scale equivalent of a false statement; the ridiculous nature of a claim does not alter the \u201cfalseness\u201d of it, but instead adds a qualifier about how the claim is made. Converting values of the pants on fire category to false produced a similar result, r (107) = .447, p < .001.\nDeceptiveness agreements systematically decrease from pants on fire distinctions to half truths ( Fig 1 ). Half truths have a seemingly random distribution of Pinocchios and there is near perfect agreement for pants on fire statements. This suggests that there is moderate deceptiveness agreement across The Washington Post Fact Checker\u2019s Pinocchios and the Truth-O-Meter from PolitiFact. Correlations show general agreement but blurring of adjacent categories is also common. Most discrepancies were only off by one category, and there were only 6 instances of being off by two category discrepancies. Major off-diagonal disagreements were largely exaggerations by President Trump that The Washington Post considered egregious and PolitiFact believed they had some validity. For example, three examples in the top left corner of Fig 1 related to exaggerations by President Trump (e.g., \u201cI\u2019ve won awards on environmental protection;\u201d 4 Pinocchio\u2019s), but were half-truths via PolitiFact (he received a personal award for donating land in New York State after not building a golf course there).\nFig 1.

Discussion\nThis paper focused on how much two prominent fact-checking sources, The Washington Post \u2019s Fact Checker and PolitiFact, agreed on the statements to fact-check and the strength of their deceptiveness ratings. The study examined presidential fact-checks, and the data suggest some divergence in what to check. Deceptiveness ratings were moderately correlated for The Washington Post and PolitiFact, suggesting general agreement on the presence of falsity but indicating variability in severity assessments of false or misleading statements.\nOur work is among the first studies to compare leading fact-checkers across two presidents and multiple sources. As described, there are two potential reasons for the fact-checking disagreements beyond substantive errors. RQ 1 addresses the first of these by asking how major fact-checking organizations vary regarding the fact-checking triggers. We observed that the sampling frame for each source can be different, which therefore leads to disagreements in whether statements are checked. PolitiFact indicates they check statements based on five criteria: (1) Is the statement rooted in a fact that is verifiable? (2) Does the statement seem misleading or sound wrong? (3) Is the statement significant? (4) Is the statement likely to be passed on and repeated by others? (5) Would a typical person hear or read the statement and wonder: Is that true? The Washington Post \u2019s Fact Checker, on the other hand, evaluates \u201cthe statements of political figures regarding issues of great importance, be they national, international or local\u201d [ 42 ]. According to the Fact Checker, inquiries are often provided by readers and then The Washington Post \u2019s staff evaluates statements for the truth. From these descriptions, discrepancies in the sampling frame might be anticipated. PolitiFact employs a stricter set of criteria to begin the fact-check process and seemingly does not solicit input from readers. The Washington Post \u2019s Fact Checker casts a wider net on the statements to fact-check. This was especially the case for President Trump as they set out to do a comprehensive review of his statements over time. These differences are noticeable and appear to affect the data.\nA second reason for the fact-checking disagreements might be related to each source\u2019s definition of deception. RQ 2 asked whether the scales used by different organizations yield similar interpretations of the fact-checking results. In our review of The Washington Post and PolitiFact methods, we could not find a clear conceptual definition of deception as stated by the fact-checkers. However, each source\u2019s operational definitions, in the form of deceptiveness ratings, offer some perspective into such conceptualizations. PolitiFact\u2019s false statements range from omissions to ridiculous claims, while The Washington Post \u2019s Fact Checker rates statements from \u201comissions and exaggerations, but no outright falsehoods\u201d (1 Pinocchio) to \u201cwhoppers,\u201d (4 Pinocchios) or outright ridiculous claims [ 42 ]. These conceptualizations appear reasonably consistent. Our correlation between deceptiveness ratings was moderate, however, suggesting the interpretation of what constitutes a false or misleading statement is crucial to fact-checking. Despite goals of objectivity in fact-checking and journalism, subjectivity is still a part of this enterprise, and that subjectivity appears when judgments are made about the degree of a statement\u2019s deceptiveness. There seems to be a fairly high level of agreement when a statement is false, but the degree of falseness appears to vary. This variation is not egregious, but it leaves open the question of whether the consumers of different fact-checking results see these variations as trivial or substantive.\nTaken together, our analyses lead to four top-line conclusions. First, there is considerable variability between political fact-checkers in the raw numbers of statements that are checked. This sheer volume difference is indicative of different goals by different fact-checkers. The implication is that it may not be possible to cross-check most fact-checks with other fact-checkers. Second, there is a moderate correlation in scaling. Even though most of the differences are small, such differences can create the appearance of disagreements. Thus, both selection and, to a lesser extent, scaling account for apparent discrepancies among fact-checkers. Third, bottom-line determinations of statement veracity (e.g., did the checkers agree on true-false judgments among communally fact-checked statements?) align across fact-checkers. When we independently checked statements, and when different fact-checkers independently checked the same statements, there was near consensus about whether the statement was true or false. While the data do not allow for a complete veracity match, across all of our comparisons, we found only one instance (out of 64 statements) where one checker assessed a statement as true and another assessed the same statement as potentially false. Disagreements were in degrees or confidence, not in kind. This leads to our fourth and final conclusion: political fact-checking is difficult, nuanced, and yet remarkably consistent across checkers once they agree on what to check. Fact-checking exhibits bottom-line validity and merits confidence.\nImplications for political fact-checking, news consumers, and deception theory\nThe current results have several implications for political fact-checkers, media scholars, and news consumers. Although understandable, differences in statement selection are substantial.\nJournalists and political fact-checkers should be aware of uniquely high-frequency deceivers (prolific liars, or those who lie prolifically; [ 43 \u2013 47 ]) and when they might be more likely to lie (e.g., as suggested by TDT, when topics are consequential or when the truth is a problem; [ 32 ]). For example, during his final year as president and as the 2020 U.S. presidential election approached, President Trump\u2019s lying rate increased dramatically compared to other years [ 23 ]. Thus, fact-check frequency should increase proportionally. Yet, fact-checkers have finite resources and they must be selective. Newsrooms and political fact-checkers should create processes to be systematic and comprehensive with their cataloguing of deception, while adjusting to variable base-rates of lying. Relatedly, the fact-checkers have a responsibility to be unbiased and balanced in their approach. Politicians and political candidates may be unequal in their frequency of deceptive messaging, but the fact-checking procedures should reveal that imbalance rather than focusing on politicians who create an a priori expectation of dishonesty. Finally, while selection variation may be clear to researchers, the implications may not be so clear to those using these fact-checking resources. Fact-checkers need to communicate these differences with greater precision and clarity to the public.\nThis investigation provides an understanding of fact-checkers\u2019 and political fact-checking blind spots. When fact-checkers disagree on what to fact-check, and their disagreements are prevalent, news consumers might doubt what they read and how much they trust a source. The implications of fact-checking disagreements are exacerbated when they become aggregated in news stories, read by a wide circulation on social media, or when a concerned citizen cannot find the same statement fact-checked by another source. News consumers should not have to doubt or fact-check the fact-checkers. Perhaps having a consistent set of standards in journalistic fact-checking (e.g., definitions of deception, deceptiveness rating systems that are consistent across sources) and removing ad-hoc policies at the source level will alleviate public concerns about fact assessments. More widely promoting and creating public awareness of fact-checking standards might also be beneficial ( https://www.poynter.org/ifcn/ ).\nFinally, in response to RQ 3 about the degree to which TDT applies to journalistic fact-checking, it is also important to describe how our results inform truth-default theory [ 32 , 37 ]. Our evidence suggests bottom-line judgments of statement veracity were almost perfectly aligned for professional fact-checkers. Among those checked by PolitiFact, there were broad similarities and modest differences across scaling compared to those checked by The Washington Post . Therefore, fact-checkers agree on veracity when they both check a statement, but their selection and scaling can be misaligned. These results inform truth-default theory because the theory champions fact-checking (labeled in the theory as correspondence information) as one of the most preferred methods of lie detection. Our results show that fact-checking appears valid, and the theory can be applied to non-interactive (e.g., not interpersonal) settings of consequence (e.g., political and journalistic fact-checking). The process of detecting deception is not limited to one individual confirming the veracity of another. The triggers for suspicion can arise from many sources, and while the fact-checking organization functions in ways that are analogous to an individual\u2019s efforts to confirm or disconfirm a message, the results may be widely circulated to a mass audience of news consumers.\nAccording to truth-default theory, most people presume a message is honest independent of its actual veracity [ 32 , 37 ]. Therefore, if false or misleading statements are not fact-checked (or not agreed upon to be fact-checked by multiple sources), their ability to mislead the public goes unchallenged. The truth-default remains until a trigger exists. Fact-checking can serve as a trigger or be the response to a trigger. Nevertheless, absent public confidence in fact-checkers, the utility of the triggering function is undercut.\nOur test of TDT in the domain of fact-checking has implications beyond U.S. fact-checking sources like The Washington Post Fact Checker and PolitiFact because the theory is pan-cultural [ 32 , 37 ]. As prior work suggests, the theory\u2019s \u201ccore presumptions concern human nature and are not tied to any particular culture, religion, government, or social structure\u201d [ 44 ], suggesting that its principles, propositions, and foundations can extend to fact-checking in other regions of the world. Fact-checking efforts are global due to the pervasive and consequential nature of disinformation [ 2 \u2013 5 ] and therefore, it may be helpful for future work to compare how fact-checking approaches can inform each other in a pursuit of best practices, identifying elusive perpetrators of false information, and understanding cultural differences related to the dissemination and detection of such false information. Lessons from political fact-checking\nWe learned that political fact-checking is difficult, and fact-checkers face nontrivial challenges as they try to evaluate the truth. In some cases, as our analysis involving Snopes and FactCheck.org revealed, only one organization will fact-check a claim. People often want information fast, though fact-checking requires time and thorough investigation. Even then, fact-checkers are susceptible to human error and human biases that might affect their judgment. We advocate for reliability estimates in fact-checking and cross-checking sources to ensure consistent and credible news. Two of the coders in the PolitiFact, Snopes, and FactCheck.org cross-check also noticed that FactCheck.org \u2019s search algorithm was enhanced by Google. Therefore, if sorted by \u201cRelevance,\u201d coders or fact-checkers might receive slightly different search results on FactCheck.org because of a person\u2019s unique Google history and what Google assumes the searcher would be interested in. Algorithmic bias in fact-checking and citizens\u2019 experiences should be acknowledged. Limitations and future directions\nOur investigations purposefully chose premier fact-checkers across analyses, but there are others that would be worthy of evaluation in future work. We selected The Washington Post \u2019s Fact Checker, PolitiFact, and others because of their popularity and deceptiveness scaling, but more sources, including those outside the U.S. could be assessed as well (e.g., CNN, USA Today, Agence France-Presse, and other members of the International Fact-Checking Network). A cross-cultural analysis of fact-checking might be helpful to illuminate cultural or norms-based differences in what people decide to fact-check and how veracity might be scored differently. However, this may require new methods as the opportunity for direct comparison of checked facts is limited. We also evaluated two presidents in this paper. Therefore, it will be important to evaluate how checkers might continue to disagree on facts from other political figures.\nAlthough the results of this work described disagreement between two main fact-checkers, it is unclear why these patterns emerged. We offered two possible explanations based on methodological and theory-based evidence, though future work would benefit from interviewing fact-checkers to understand their process and decisions on what to check in difficult cases [ 48 ]. Pairing qualitative evidence about editorial decision-making and fact-checking principles with quantitative work would make for a more holistic evaluation of how much fact-checking disagreements exist and why they might exist.\nIn addition, we only evaluated false statements when comparing PolitiFact and The Washington Post ; comparing true and false statements required additional fact-checking with Snopes and FactCheck.org . Therefore, a limitation of some analyses is that we cannot evaluate potential disagreements on truths, which are also critical to fact-checking. Nonetheless, the data suggest that fact-check results are mostly accurate. It is also important to note that while coders made independent cross-checks and were reliable in the paper, future work may consider additional approaches to confirm objectivity. For example, it is unclear if artificial intelligence (e.g., ChatGPT) can perform cross-checks, but this may be an important step to consider.\nFinally, our research focused on the actions of the fact-checkers. When assessing the outcomes of fact-checking, it would be useful to obtain feedback from the consumers of fact-checking news. If a news consumer observed that a fact-checker had an incorrect fact-check, does this impact the source\u2019s credibility and if so, what can be done to repair it? While our professional judgments resulted in a high level of agreement, news consumers\u2014who may be untrained and whose judgments may be constrained by past exposure to the candidates, biased by repetitive exposure to the messages being checked, or influenced by the values of others with whom they interact\u2014may not interpret fact-checking results with the same clarity or be universally forgiving if a mistakenly incorrect fact-check occurs. This suggests that the results not only need to be accurate, but they need to be credible. Supporting information\nS1 File (DOCX)\nClick here for additional data file.

How to Fact-Check\nBy the end of this chapter, you should have an idea of how to fact-check a standard work of journalism, including how to prepare for and conduct fact-checking interviews, how to work with documentary sources, and how to format your fact-checking documents and keep comprehensive records. In the sections from General Methodology to After the Fact-Check , we elaborate on steps 4 to 9 of the editorial process as described in the previous chapter. In Variations and Adapting to Constraints , we acknowledge that not every publication will be able to meet the ideal outlined here, and we discuss how to adapt these guidelines for different newsroom structures and resource constraints.\nThe practical advice given here is inspired by the thorough methodology practised by many magazines in the glory days of editorial fact-checking. It has also been informed by our experiences in the industry over the past decade, additional research into journalism practices and ethics, and conversations with more than fifty journalists, researchers, and community members (whose names are listed at the end of Chapter One .\nGeneral Methodology\nFact-checking can generally be broken down into three steps:\nVerification : Given a statement and the reporter's sources for that statement, the fact checker confirms that the statement is factual, identifies errors and suggests corrections, or determines that neither of these options is possible.\nInvestigation : The fact checker assesses the credibility of the sources used by the reporter and finds out what other credible sources say about the statement in question. Is there any nuance or context missing from the statement? Have any sourcing considerations been overlooked or misjudged?\nDocumentation : After the statement is confirmed or corrected, the fact checker preserves all sources, documents, and methodology for their (and their publication's) fact-checking records.\nThe reporter is responsible for ensuring the accuracy of every word that appears in their piece; the fact checker should be able to defend the accuracy of every word. This requires a documented source for every statement\u2014even the obvious or seemingly insignificant ones. Being \" checking sure \" that a fact is correct is a higher standard than being \"virtually certain.\" Doing the work to collect corroborating evidence, even if the fact is considered common knowledge, is a more reliable path to accuracy than relying on what we think we know.\nHere is a non-exhaustive list of details that should always be checked in a work of journalism:\nNames, dates, and locations\nQuotes and the facts within quotes\nDescriptions of people, places, and events\nPronouns, identifiers, and descriptors\nCausal explanations\nThe factual bases of opinions\nThe internal logic of a story, including its chronology\nWhile it's important to check every fact in a story, it's also important to prioritize where you spend your time. Some facts are easily verifiable and uncontroversial, so they can be checked quickly; others are relatively extraneous and, if they cannot be verified, can likely be cut from the story without affecting the narrative; others, however, deserve more time and investigative effort. Over time, with experience and the support of their editorial team, fact checkers learn to make these kinds of pragmatic decisions on their own.\nSome facts may not be verifiable\u2014either because the necessary sources do not exist or because they are inaccessible. (That rare book you're looking for may be impossible to access before your deadline, or the second party in an argument may vehemently refuse to speak with journalists.) In these cases, the fact checker tries to find other ways of corroborating the facts, with the help of the reporter. But in keeping with the value of transparency , the fact checker is also responsible for recognizing the limitations of verification in various contexts and communicating them to the editorial team.\nIt's important to convey the uncertainty surrounding a particular fact to the story's handling editor so that they can decide how best to adapt the story. They may choose to make the uncertainty itself part of the story: transparency about what journalists do and do not know is a way of giving audiences the power to make informed judgments on the information and narratives presented.\nFact checkers only suggest changes to a story; in most cases (unless the head of research becomes involved), the handling editor has final say on how a fact checker's corrections are implemented.\nBelow, we describe the standard methodology for fact-checking (separated into Preparation , Verification and Investigation , and Documentation ) and go through some Topic-Specific Advice .\nPreparation\nOnce the fact checker has been assigned a story, they read the latest draft to get a sense of what the assignment will require. Even if the story is still being edited and they haven't received the reporter's research package yet, it's a good idea to get started as early as possible: note how many people they think they will have to call, what kinds of gathered sources they expect to receive, and any foreseeable difficulties in verification. The fact checker also conducts background research that will help them become more familiar with the topic of the story and assess the appropriateness of the sourcing decisions made by the reporter\u2014for example, by reading literature reviews, encyclopedia entries, and news articles about the topic at hand. (As we note in Chapter Eight , this is especially important if the story is about a marginalized community with which the fact checker is not familiar.)\nOnce the fact checker has received the research package, they make a copy of the annotated draft and remove the footnotes. This will be the checking copy . The checking copy is the fact checker's master document, where they track their work as they go, and it's also the primary reference for anyone else who may later go through the fact-checking folder in order to determine the sourcing for a fact.\nEven though the fact checker builds their fact-checking folder digitally (see the Documentation section of this chapter), we recommend printing out a copy of the story when beginning a fact check. Doing so can help the fact checker organize their thoughts and plan out their approach to the check. We advise printing this copy double-spaced to leave room for comments, in pen or pencil, on the document.\nAs the fact checker reads through the draft (or printed copy), they keep the reporter's research package close at hand so that they can refer to their sources and comments. They pay special attention to the reporter's annotations: Are any sources missing? Do any interview subjects require special care? Is anything unclear? If so, the fact checker compiles their questions and concerns to send to the reporter, or they schedule a meeting with the reporter, handling editor, and head of research to discuss the best way forward.\nIf the fact checker has any questions about how to fact-check the story\u2014for example, because they think a source will ask for accommodations (see Chapter Seven ) or they are unsure how to assess a source (see Chapter Four )\u2014they discuss them with the head of research before getting started.\nIf there are illustrations, photographs, or infographics accompanying a work of journalism, they need to be fact-checked alongside everything else. The fact checker should receive these materials in the research package and include them in their checking copy and checked copy ; if they don't receive any, they should check in with the handling editor, since the reporter may not have been involved in creating graphics for their story.\nFact-checkers must be critical readers. If you don't clearly understand what a sentence means, you can't very well check its veracity. Also, the facts won't always present themselves to you on a plate\u2014you may need to extract them from statements in which fact and opinion are intertwined. Or you may need to infer the facts from passages in which they are not explicitly stated.\n\u2014Cynthia Brouse, After the Fact: A Guide to Fact-Checking for Magazines and Other Media (2007)\nVerification and Investigation\nFact checkers work with two kinds of sources: gathered sources (the records and documents they consult) and interviewed sources (the people they speak with). These require different approaches and methods of documentation, which we outline below.\nWhatever sources the fact checker is working with, their primary activity is to consider each isolated fact, consult the source the reporter has attributed it to, and confirm that everything lines up. But they sometimes have to do more investigation to clarify the fact, refute it, or attribute it to more reliable sources.\nShannon Palus, a veteran science fact checker and senior editor for Slate , says that a fact checker needs to know more than what is necessary for the confirmation or correction of the statement in question. For example, \"last Christmas\" in a 2022 story should become \"December 25, 2021\" in a fact-checking document. That level of detail may not be necessary for the story, but it's crucial for triangulating with other sources and ensuring that the timeline of the story is accurate.\nSimilarly, if the reporter uses a complex term or technical jargon in their story, the fact checker finds out what it means and includes that definition in their files. In doing so, they verify that the reporter has used the term appropriately, even if the term isn't defined in the story itself.\nAfter reading through the story in full (we recommend doing so more than once), the first thing the fact checker does is contact interviewed sources to schedule fact-checking calls. It's helpful to do this early, since not everyone will respond right way. The reporter should have made notes about any interview subjects' particularities\u2014frequent travellers who are difficult to contact, for example. The fact checker can use this information to plan ahead for their fact-checking calls.\nThe fact checker's initial message to a source (usually an email) should explain their intentions clearly, name the reporter, describe the topic of the story, and remind the source of when the original interview happened. It should identify the sender as a fact checker and explain that it's their job to make sure that the sources in the piece (and their ideas, work, and experiences) are presented accurately and fairly. It should then request a phone call within a reasonable time frame. (We usually request that sources respond within a week, but it depends on individual deadlines.) It's a good idea to leave time between the initial message and the first phone call to prepare questions and conduct research using gathered sources .\nIf the source does not answer, subsequent messages should include a firm deadline and communicate clearly that, if they do not speak with the fact checker in time, the checker may resort to using interview recordings or transcripts for confirmation (depending on what is available). Correspondence between the fact checker and the interviewed sources should be documented in the fact-checking folder.\nAs the fact checker is waiting for responses to their interview requests, they begin isolating the facts from the story however they prefer (we like to use coloured pens on the printed copy of the draft\u2014one colour for each interviewed source, another for all gathered sources). During this process, they make notes about the kinds of sourcing the reporter has attributed to each fact. These notes will be helpful for working through the fact check, especially if the story is particularly long or complex.\nWhile delineating the facts of the story, the fact checker should remain conscious of the big picture, make sure that the facts are presented without significant omissions, and confirm that the takeaway of the story is fair, plausible, and backed up by the available evidence. If there's a\u00a0narrative arc to the story, it can be helpful to draw out a timeline to ensure that everything is in logical order.\nFor any detail that seems shaky or controversial, the fact checker should be proactive in finding extra sources, even if they weren't originally consulted by the reporter for the story. However, if the fact checker is thinking of scheduling interviews with new sources, they should check with the reporter's research package first. (The reporter may have already reached out to that person and been denied an interview, or they may have a personal relationship that would make the source's participation inappropriate.)\nIf a fact seems impossible or very difficult to check, the fact checker consults with the head of research . If the fact checker finds that a fact is incorrect or unprovable and has an idea for an alternative, they can suggest it to the handling editor\u2014either during fact-check input or, if it will require a substantial rewrite, earlier on.\nNote: it's important for the fact checker to document their work as they go. That means you should read this entire chapter (including the Documentation instructions) before considering yourself ready for your first fact check.\nAuthoritative and Non-Authoritative Sources\nFact-checking involves sorting through, assessing, and documenting the reporter's gathered sources\u2014the published documents, online media, journal articles, and other records that they consulted during their reporting\u2014as well as having conversations with their interviewed sources.\nIt's important to think critically about the kinds of sources you have been given. The general rule of editorial fact-checking is that each fact should be confirmed with at least one primary source or two secondary sources. This is a helpful baseline, but it warrants some clarification.\nThe distinction between primary and secondary sources comes from historical research. For a historian, primary sources were produced during the time period being researched (such as diary entries, letters, and meeting notes) whereas secondary sources were produced later, by people who did not experience the time period first-hand (such as books or articles by other historians). Journalists have adapted this distinction to their own work: in The Chicago Guide to Fact-Checking , Brooke Borel describes primary sources as \"the closest you can get to the origin of a fact,\" while secondary sources \"may be a step or more removed from a primary source.\" Secondary sources interpret the facts via their own sources; primary sources give the facts.\nIn practice, it can be difficult to clearly and consistently classify sources in this way. Different publications and institutions classify primary and secondary sources differently, and the \"one primary source or two secondary sources\" rule is not always helpful for fact checkers. Some \"secondary\" sources, such as encyclopedia articles, can be reliable on their own, while some \"primary\" sources, such as government websites, can be full of errors. Instead of being guided by the primary/secondary source distinction, fact checkers should distinguish between authoritative and non-authoritative sources . We will discuss this idea at greater length in Chapter Four , but the important point is that authority is fact-relative: the kind of source that suffices to check a fact depends on the fact.\nFor example, someone's personal website is an authoritative source on how they spell their name and self-identify. But it is not an authoritative source on the ingredients used in the cream sauce at the restaurant they visited last week, even if they wrote a lengthy blog post about it. This is because the fact checker presumably doesn't know how the blog post was reported or according to what standard of accuracy it was produced. Instead, an authoritative source for that cream sauce recipe would be a picture of the recipe book the restaurant used, a phone call with the chef, or a fact-checked review of the restaurant published around the time of the blogger's visit.\nThe Independence Principle holds that each fact should be checked with at least one authoritative source or, if that is not possible, several independent non-authoritative sources. Fact checkers should avoid citing two news articles to confirm a fact: those articles may have been based on the same report, meaning they are not independent. It would be better to find the report itself and cite it directly.\nIf a fact can be verified only by non-authoritative sources, it may require in-text attribution to those sources\u2014for example, the addition of \"according to the Washington Post. \" The fact checker can suggest this kind of attribution as a correction in their checked copy.\nAuthoritative sources include:\nPeople on their own experiences and identities (including autobiographies)\nFirst-hand accounts, such as diary entries, photographs, video, audio, or witnesses of an event\nAn expert or spokesperson who represents community consensus on an issue\nKnowledge (of any form) that has already been fact-checked or has been produced using reliable methods and with integrity\nNon-authoritative sources include:\nNews articles on descriptions of people or events\nWitnesses describing other people's experiences\nPeople close to a person quoted or mentioned in a story\nKnowledge (of any form) that is not known to have been fact-checked or produced using reliable methods and with integrity\nThese lists can help the fact checker evaluate the sources cited in the reporter's research package. Whether a source should be considered authoritative depends on the fact and on the context of the story in which it is presented. For example, the same person can serve as an authoritative source on their own experience of an event while serving as a non-authoritative source on their sibling's experience of the same event.\nThere are many situations in which a non-authoritative source will nevertheless be the best source available. For example, a person close to someone mentioned in a story may be the most authoritative source possible if the person mentioned is not available to speak. But, because the friend of the source is a non-authoritative source, the Independence Principle dictates that the fact checker find additional corroborating sources and that the reporter be transparent with readers about the fact that they weren't able to speak with the most authoritative source on the matter.\nSources You Gather\nEvery gathered source used to confirm or refute a fact is saved in the fact-checking folder (as a PDF, media file, or otherwise) and assigned a number in its title. The fact checker marks the passages of the source that are directly relevant to the fact check so they can be easily found by others reviewing their work later on. If the source is a PDF, for example, the fact checker highlights the specific lines of text that confirm the fact (or the lines that refute it, if the source is in support of a correction the fact checker is suggesting). Media such as audio or video should include the relevant timestamps and, if possible, audio transcriptions.\nIn Chapter Four , we explain in greater detail how a fact checker may go about assessing the authority of a gathered source by asking how, why, where, when, and by whom it was created. Most of the time, the sources used by the reporter are adequate, and the fact checker needs only to confirm that the sources provided in the research package correspond to the facts of the story. If the fact is a direct quotation from a gathered source, make sure the punctuation and spelling has been preserved\u2014the quotation should match how it was written in the original source, even if it conflicts with your publication's house style.\nFor books that cannot be saved as PDFs, the fact checker scans or photographs pages that contain relevant information. Note that books\u2014just like newspapers, websites, and other such records\u2014are typically not fact-checked, so they do not count as authoritative sources on anything apart from their author's experiences, thoughts, and opinions. In The Fact Checker's Bible , Sarah Harrison Smith writes that \"some books may be even more dangerous to check from than newspapers\" because so few books have been produced with fact-checking in mind. If the reporter has used a book as a source for something other than a personal fact about the book's author, look at the references in the body of the text, the footnotes, or the bibliography to try to find out where the author got that information.\nSources You Speak With\nNearly every person quoted, cited by the reporter (even on background), named, or otherwise identifiable in a piece needs to be contacted during fact-checking. The fact checker may need to call additional people who weren't initially interviewed for the piece in order to verify hard-to-source facts. Together, these are the interviewed sources.\nNo one should be surprised to read their name in a journalistic story. It's important that the fact checker contact everyone (including companies, organizations, and institutions) named in a story, even if they weren't originally interviewed by the reporter (though the reporter should have at least tried to get in touch with them). The fact checker calls each source in turn to go over the relevant facts of the story, including everything the source originally told the reporter and any additional information from the story that concerns them.\nFor example, if the reporter names someone who was involved in a car accident, that name may be available on the police report included in the research package . But the fact checker will still make a reasonable effort to contact them to ensure that the report accurately conveys their experience and the spelling of their name. If the reporter reached out to that source earlier and was denied an interview or never heard back, they should have included copies of their unanswered emails in their research package, which the fact-checker will then save in their fact-checking folder . Depending on how significant a role the person plays in the story, it may also be appropriate for the fact checker to reach out again and request a fact-checking interview despite already having evidence that the source did not respond to the reporter. These new attempts to contact the source (emails, the times and dates of phone calls and voicemails, etc.) will also be recorded in the fact-checking folder.\nAn exception can be made for public information about public figures, which can often be confirmed with other authoritative sources. The fact checker does not need to arrange a fact-checking call with the prime minister, for example, to confirm a statement from a press conference\u2014though they may want to reach out to the prime minister's media team for a transcript of the press conference if one is not readily available elsewhere. Any private details about the prime minister's life, however, are ideally checked with them directly, not with their media team.\nOn top of the reporter's sources, the fact checker should consider calling anyone they think may help them confirm a fact, such as witnesses of an event or friends of an interviewed source. If the fact checker is struggling to check a story because of its technicality or complexity, they can reach out to an expert in the relevant field\u2014someone the reporter did not speak with\u2014and arrange a fact-checking interview to discuss the relevant facts. Many experts are happy to help, and if they're too busy to participate, they will often point you in the direction of others to ask.\nExperts can also provide general context for a piece beyond the specifics the fact checker needs to verify. Speaking with an expert early in the checking process is a good way of getting up to speed on the subject matter. For example, if you are fact-checking a story about nuclear physics that was written by an experienced science writer, it may help to speak with a nuclear physicist about the basics of their field before getting started.\nFact-checking calls with background sources and experts are always on background \u2014for the sake of the Two-Layer Principle , the fact checker would not include a quote from a fact-checking call in the text of the story without it going through additional verification. When contacting additional sources for verification purposes, the fact checker should be clear about why they are reaching out and explain that the call is purely for background corroboration, ensuring the source understands that they are not doing original reporting but instead trying to verify information reported by someone else.\nWe advise against using interview recordings and transcripts to check people's quotes and personal facts apart from in special cases (see Chapters Seven and Eight ), such as when it is impossible to reach someone directly. We also advise against emailing questions to a source unless there are good reasons for doing so (such as accessibility considerations, which we discuss in Chapter Eight ). Practically speaking, it's much easier to build a rapport when speaking with someone over the phone, on video, or in person. Establishing a baseline of trust is important for any journalistic endeavour, and fact-checking is no different: a conversation can go a long way in making a source feel comfortable, heard, and respected.\nOpen conversation is also most conducive to accuracy as it allows the fact checker to discuss the facts with the source in detail and, if a fact has been misstated, to make sure that they understand why the statement is wrong and what a correction would require. Sources will often ask for questions to be emailed, but if the fact checker explains the benefits of a live conversation, they will usually agree to a call instead.\nI want to go to people even when the interviews are taped, because things change or you could ask the question slightly differently and get a different answer.\n\u2014Peter Canby, former head of fact-checking, The New Yorker\nThose of us who were checking in the pre-web days can scarcely recall how we fact-checked without it. One way was by very quickly losing our fear of telephoning strangers, since that was our primary checking tool. My colleagues and I used to complain of getting \"checker's ear,\" a kind of red rash caused by hours of contact with a telephone receiver. Young checkers today, with the web at their fingertips, sometimes give me a terrified look when I suggest they should telephone a source, as much as to say, \"Is that allowed?\" E-mail and text-messaging have made the telephone call seem a tad antiquated, but the phone is still a powerful tool. And if your goal is to use fact-checking as a stepping stone to becoming a writer, talking to sources on the phone is excellent training.\n\u2014Cynthia Brouse, After the Fact: A Guide to Fact-Checking for Magazines and Other Media (2007)\nIf an interviewed source has not returned repeated calls or emails, the fact checker notifies the handling editor and head of research promptly so that they can decide on an alternative course of action to verify the fact. Fact checkers should avoid putting all of their eggs in one basket\u2014while waiting for one person to call back, call another and then another.\nIf a source is reluctant to participate in the fact-checking process, it can help to remind them that fact-checking is a service they are being provided: it is in their best interest to participate since doing so will help ensure that they are being accurately represented. Inform them that, if they refuse to participate, you will have to rely instead on audio recordings and interview notes (if there are any) to fact-check their contribution to the story. In some cases, however, a source's refusal to participate in fact-checking may mean that their contribution to the piece is modified or removed entirely. Preserve these exchanges for your records.\nConducting Fact-Checking Interviews\nAs soon as the fact checker has sent out requests to interviewed sources (even before any have responded), they begin to prepare for fact-checking calls. The fact checker does background research before every call, checking that none of the facts they're hoping to confirm with a source are obviously wrong.\nIdeally, the fact checker will be able to schedule fact-checking calls ahead of time and will prepare questions for sources while conducting documentary research. That way, they will be familiar with most of the story's gathered sources by the time a fact-checking call takes place.\nHere are the steps to preparing a list of fact-checking questions for an interviewed source:\nOpen a new document (a separate one for every source) and save it under the source's name and their assigned letter of the alphabet (this is important for Documentation ). At the top of the document, note the source's name and contact information.\nBelow their contact information, leave space to note the date(s) and time(s) you called the source, the medium you used (phone, Facebook message, Skype, Zoom, etc.), whether they answered or you left a voicemail, and any other pertinent details. It's important to document this process, even if it's a long line of unanswered voicemails, because you may later need to reference the date and time a conversation took place or prove that you made reasonable efforts to contact someone.\nRefer to your checking copy (and possibly your printed copy of the story, if you decided to print), in which you previously delineated the facts. Ideally, you will have underlined in colour, highlighted, or otherwise demarcated every fact in the piece that was attributed to the source in question. Read through the story and write down each of these facts separately in your interview document.\nMake sure you have not missed any facts that should be presented to the source during the call\u2014even if the reporter did not attribute them to that person. For example, if the reporter included a description of the food at a conference, and you know that the source you're speaking with attended the same conference, you could include that food fact in your list of questions for the source, to see if they remember the same thing. Make sure to note in your document (and clarify to the source in the call) that this information is not attributed to them in the text.\nNow that you have compiled the facts in your document, turn them into a numbered list, rephrasing the statements as questions as you go. You should begin your list of questions with the spelling of the source's name (if they are named in the story), their pronouns, their occupation and position (if relevant), and their date of birth (if relevant). (If they are confused about needing to provide their date of birth instead of simply confirming their age, explain that you need to make sure that their printed age will be accurate whenever the final version of the story is published; their date of birth likely won't be published.)\nWhen rephrasing facts as questions, paraphrase everything (including direct quotes) except for the most technical details and any personal language (see Chapter Five ). The facts in your list of questions should be presented in manageable chunks instead of full sentences. One statement from the story may be separated into several questions for a source: it's your job to parse out the facts from the statement, understand them, and check them individually during the call. Make sure to rephrase facts as yes-or-no questions or statements that can be confirmed or denied rather than as open-ended questions; this saves time and prevents confusion.\nBe ready to ask follow-up questions. Remember that your job will be done only when you understand what was right and wrong in a story, how a statement should be corrected, and why\u2014not just when you have a yes or no response about a fact.\nFor quotations, verify not only that the person said what has been attributed to them but also that its content is accurate. For example, \"The Statue of Liberty is the tallest human-built structure in the world,\" Randy said , has two main facts: (1) that Randy said this about the Statue of Liberty, and (2) that the Statue of Liberty is indeed the tallest human-built structure. If Randy has authority on the subject, he can be an authoritative source for both facts. If not, you will have to confirm the second one independently\u2014and during your phone call with Randy, you can ask for advice on how to confirm the statement. (A third and fourth fact to check would be: (3) that the Statue of Liberty is the correct name of the structure, and (4) that it is indeed human-built. These should be easy to check independently.)\nOnce you've written out the questions you plan to ask a source, rearrange them in your document. Don't list them in the same order in which the facts appear in the story\u2014journalistic stories tend to begin with the most dramatic or controversial details, which is not how we like to begin our interactions with sources.\nIt's best to begin by asking the least difficult or controversial questions. You can even include some buffer questions at the beginning of the call or throughout to help the source feel comfortable and ensure they understand how fact-checking works before getting into the grittier details. (For example, you can ask them to confirm a few details about their hometown or their workplace, even if those details won't make it into the final draft.) Categorizing questions by subject can also help structure your conversation. (We give more suggestions for ensuring the source's comfort during a fact-checking call in Chapter Seven .)\nEnd with the most controversial questions so that, if the source hangs up or refuses to continue, you minimize the number of facts for which you are left without confirmation.\nThe final version of your interview document should include the source's name, their contact information, a record of your communications with them (or at least communication attempts), and a numbered list of questions. The document should be assigned a letter in its title and saved along with the other interview documents in your fact-checking folder.\nI have a long-espoused philosophy of what I call controlled explosions, which is that, if you have somebody saying something that you know is likely to be controversial when it's published, oftentimes you'll have writers and editors say, \"Don't check that with the person because the person will completely blow up.\" The standard of that controlled explosion is: If they're going to blow up on us about this issue, it should happen before publication and not after publication.\n\u2014Peter Canby, former head of fact-checking, The New Yorker\nOnce you have prepared the document with your list of questions for someone, you are ready to conduct a fact-checking interview with them. (You can also send the list of questions to the source via email, if that's how you've decided to conduct the interview\u2014in which case you should make sure that you have written everything out clearly and with enough detail.)\nIt's helpful to begin each call with a quick explanation of the fact-checking process since sources may not be familiar with editorial fact-checking. The explanation might go something like this:\n\"My job as a fact-checker is to go through the story line by line and make sure that every statement is accurate and backed by credible sources. I call each person the reporter interviewed to make sure that we are quoting them and representing their work fairly and accurately. This fact-checking call is your opportunity to ensure we have understood everything you previously told the reporter. During the call, I will phrase every fact as a statement or question, and you can simply answer yes if it's accurate. If it's not accurate, please tell me why and what should be changed or clarified. Do you have any questions before we get started?\" Be sure to name the reporter so that the source knows whom you are referring to.\nEven though fact-checking can feel like an exact science, the phone calls you conduct should be respectful, polite, and conversational. The source should feel that you are a good listener who cares about their perspective. But you should also be clear about your role as a fact checker: the call should not feel so informal that the source misunderstands its purpose and starts giving longer or more open-ended answers. The source should understand your fact-checking standards and feel comfortable telling you when they're not confident enough to confirm a fact.\nNever misrepresent what you're doing, even with a source who may be at odds with the story. You don't need to give away the precise angle of the reporter's story unless it is directly relevant to the source you're speaking with\u2014the questions you ask during the call will likely give them all the information they need. But, if the source asks for more detail, you should be transparent about the subject matter and tone. (For example, if you're speaking with an environmental researcher to confirm general facts about the climate crisis, you can tell them that \"___ is writing about the negative effects of coal mining on the environment\" without needing to specify that ___ is writing about how a certain coal mine is directly responsible for the destruction of its environment. If you're speaking with an employee of the coal mine, however, you should be as specific as necessary for the sake of responsible communication.)\nTalking to someone who is going to be accused of wrongdoing in the article you're checking can be a delicate balance. You don't want to be too cautious and risk the source not understanding that they are being accused of something. But you also don't want to be so forthright that you are antagonizing the source unnecessarily\u2014there's a line between being direct and being combative, and you want to stay on the non-aggressive side, usually, as a fact checker. But, if the published piece is going to be accusing a person or a company of something, they should know that, and they should be given a chance to meaningfully respond to that accusation.\n\u2014Erin Sylvester, Managing Editor, The Walrus\nYou should have the list of questions open during your call with a source. Note the date and time of the call at the top of the document. While speaking with the source, note their answers beside each question, and note any clarification that a source may provide with their yes or no answer. Even if a source says yes to a question, it's important to note that confirmation in the document so that it doesn't look like you've skipped the question\u2014a detail that could become especially important in the case of a lawsuit. (We suggest writing a Y or a checkmark beside every confirmed statement.) Be as specific as possible about their responses: those details may be useful when the editor is rewriting a statement in the story. Always let your sources know that you may need to call again with further questions or follow-ups.\nNever promise a source that you will make a specific correction in a story\u2014all you can promise is that you will include their answers in your fact-checking records and that you will suggest all necessary corrections to the story's handling editor. If a source is pressing you for more, remind them of your role as a fact checker: you report to the handling editor and the head of research, who make the final decision. If they are still concerned, refer them to the head of research.\nDon't send the draft of a story (or an excerpt) to a source or read any passage to them verbatim (see Chapters Seven and Eight for some possible exceptions). You can tell sources who make such requests that the fact-checking process is meant to give them a chance to review any information that pertains to them without having undue influence on the story.\nYou can make audio recordings of any fact-checking interviews that you expect to be controversial or necessary for reference (for example, if the source denies having said something or if the reporter flags them as having been uncooperative). In general, however, you do not need to record a fact-checking phone call. As long as you are typing the source's answers into your interview document, that document will serve as a record of the conversation.\nIf a source denies having said something but you have the reporter's interview recording proving that they did, you should tell them that you have it and ask them about the discrepancy. Do so politely\u2014there may be good reasons for their quote to change, or they may simply have misremembered their conversation with the reporter. But, if you have reason to suspect that the source is trying to manipulate the facts (for example, if they are a politician who has been caught saying something problematic, and you have this on tape), you may nevertheless decide to stick with the interview recording. You should consult with the head of research before doing so and then inform the interviewed source of your decision.\nIf you cannot speak with a source\u2014because they refused to participate in fact-checking, they were unavailable in your time frame, or they did not respond to multiple requests for an interview\u2014you can rely on an audio recording of their interview provided by the reporter (assuming one was provided). First, listen to the audio recording for context. In a document, write down the name of the audio file and time stamps for relevant quotes. Transcribe the quotes verbatim, including the twenty seconds before and twenty seconds after. Save the document and audio recording in your fact-checking folder.\nIf there are no audio recordings of the interview, you can rely on the reporter's handwritten interview notes. However, if you are fact-checking a quote using handwritten notes, then you can confirm only what has been written down: if the notes are indecipherable scribbles and unconnected words, then they cannot confirm the grammatically correct sentence that the reporter has attributed to the source in their draft. Since handwritten notes are rarely able to capture what someone said verbatim, checking with handwritten notes often means you will have to suggest rewriting or paraphrasing sources' quotes in the text.\nDocumentation\nWe cannot overemphasize the importance of this final step in fact-checking: document everything and do it as you go . You will spend many hours (or days) at your desk trying to retrace your steps if you don't keep track of your sources and build your fact-checking folder in tandem with your research work. Avoiding this is worth the minor inconvenience of documenting your work every few minutes.\nDocumentation is an essential part of fact-checking: it helps with clarity and precision, it allows you to retrace your steps, and it means that any other member of the editorial team can return to your work\u2014even years later\u2014and identify the source of a fact. As previously mentioned, documentation is also helpful for legal protection, to establish that you and your colleagues practised responsible communication .\nThe fact-checking folder is a digital folder that contains all of the fact checker's work on a story, including every gathered source, every interview document, and PDFs of any email exchanges, as well as the checking and checked copies and the reporter's annotated draft. Typically, fact-checking folders are stored on the publication's internal server or shared network (Google Drive, for example), and they are kept for a minimum of three years, often much longer. The fact-checking folder title should include the fact checker's name, the reporter's name, and the date. It should also be organized into subfolders: one for gathered sources, one for interview documents, and one for all versions and working copies of the story itself.\nEvery gathered source (a document, an image, a screenshot of a website or social media page, etc.) should be assigned a number in its title. When a fact is attributed to a source, make a comment on that fact in your checking copy and note the number of the source in question. For example, the phrase That afternoon in the park, Allison and Viviane took a break from discussing the ethics of fact-checking and quietly sipped their coffees while looking up at the blue sky might have a comment on the words blue sky with the number 34, where 34 is the number given to a screenshot of the weather report for that day.\nInterviews are saved separately (one document for every source) in the fact-checking folder and assigned a letter. The questions in each interview document should be numbered starting at 1. So, if you comment \"34, A4, D9\" on blue sky , that means it was checked not only using source 34 (the weather report screenshot) but also question 4 in interview A and question 9 in interview D (likely the questions in your interviews with Allison and Viviane that confirm the appearance of the sky that day).\nIf you have identified a correction, include it in the same comment that lists the sources to which it is attributed. (A correction should always have at least one source attached to it.) Begin the comment with CORRECTION so that others can easily identify them when reviewing your checking copy. The correction should succinctly explain why the statement is wrong and, if possible, suggest a fix. Try to minimize changes to the story and include detailed information so that the handling editor has options for rewording the phrase or section in question. Keep your comments direct and to the point: the editor doesn't need to know the story of how you came to find out that the fact was wrong, but they do need to know how to fix it.\nYou should also include clarifications or other notes providing relevant contextual information that may affect the accuracy of the story. You can include those comments under the headings CLARIFICATION or NOTE . Trust your gut: anything that you think might be relevant to the accuracy or integrity of the story should be left as a comment for the record. Be clear in your comments about which changes are factually necessary and which are optional.\nYou may not be able to confirm or refute a particular fact in a story. In this case, make a comment using the label UNCONFIRMED . Your comment should include an explanation of why you did not find the reporter's source sufficient (if they provided one).\nAgain, all of this should be taking place while you fact-check\u2014the checking copy and fact-checking folder should both grow as you make your way through facts, sources, and interviews. Whenever you find a gathered source, save it immediately, give it a number, and add that number to relevant comments in your checking copy. If it confirms the fact, your work there is done; if it requires a correction, clarification, or other note, include that in the same comment. The same number-assignment process applies to any other relevant piece of information, such as audio recordings, screenshots, and images. Similarly, whenever you have conducted an interview, save that document immediately, give it a letter, and add that letter (plus the question number) to relevant comments in your checking copy.\nIn the end, your fact-checking folder should include every gathered source you've used in your fact-check (numbered), all of your correspondence and interviews with interviewed sources (lettered), the reporter's annotated draft for your records, and your checking copy. Eventually, it will also include your checked copy , the top read questions, and the post-input copy . (You can keep the printed copy with your working notes and coloured underlines/highlights in your own records as it may be helpful in the future, but there's usually no need to scan it and include it in your fact-checking folder\u2014it shouldn't contain any pertinent information that isn't also included in the checking copy.)\nBy the time you have checked every fact in the story, nearly every word of text in your document should be covered by comments that either attribute statements to sources or flags them as unconfirmed, plus corrections or clarifications as necessary.\nTopic-Specific Advice\nSome types of stories require special considerations or more technical fact-checking. We will discuss some of the most common examples in this section and others in more detail later on. If you are unsure about how to approach a certain story, it may help to consult others (such as the head of research or fellow fact checkers).\nOpinion and First-Person Pieces\nOpinion pieces are not exempt from fact-checking. The best reporting, no matter how descriptive or narrative-driven, is based on facts\u2014and those facts should be clearly presented in the reporter's annotated draft. Everyone is entitled to their opinion, but in journalism, people should give reasons for their opinions, and the fact checker's job is to make sure that those reasons stand the test of accuracy.\nSometimes, in their annotated draft, the reporter will label a fact as being \"on author.\" This term doesn't mean much on its own\u2014people use it in a variety of contradictory ways. If the reporter simply means that they remember reading the fact in question somewhere but now they can't find the source, you can ignore it (you still need a source). If they mean that this fact is their opinion, you should ask about the facts on which their opinion is based. Essentially, if a fact can be attributed to an authoritative source, it shouldn't remain \"on author.\"\nHowever, some reporters use \"on author\" to mean that they consider themselves to be the source of the information. This often happens in the context of memoirs. Our rule (which is a special case of the Personal Principle ) is that a fact can be \"on author\" in this sense only if it affects no one else, for example if the author is describing their own experience without naming any others or including any checkable external facts. Memoirs are discussed in greater detail in Chapter Six .\nOff-the-record and background sources\nMost publications ask reporters to always seek on-the-record interviews with named sources. But this is not always possible: some sources may provide information only on background, or they may ask for their names to be veiled for reasons of safety or privacy. If the reporter has come to an agreement with a source regarding their attribution status (ideally in consultation with other members of the editorial team), they should record the terms of that agreement and include it in their research package for the fact checker.\nDifferent reporters and sources have different understandings of what on background or off the record mean, so those terms alone are not enough to establish the specifics of the relationship between the source and the publication. Can they be named? Quoted? Used for background information only? Or not cited at all?\nHere is our list of attribution possibilities (inspired by the ones provided in The Chicago Guide to Fact-Checking , with some modifications):\nOn the record : Any information from the source can be published or aired and attributed to them.\nOn background : The information given by the source can be published, but the source can't be named.\nVeiled : The source is on background, and their quotes or information are not attributed to their full name (usually reporters use the person's first name only or their middle name instead, or sometimes they use a pseudonym). Alternatively, the reporter refers to the source's job or position instead of providing a name, the description of which must be agreed upon by the source and the reporter in advance.\nNot for attribution : The source is on background, and their quotes or information are not attributed to any name or personal description.\nOff the record : The information given by the source can be neither used nor attributed to them. But if the journalist is able to confirm that information with other sources, it can be published (though still not attributed to the original source).\nUsually, a source is accorded background (veiled or not for attribution) status only in cases where there is a clear and pressing need for anonymity, such as legitimate concern for the source's safety or the need to protect their personal privacy. (One special case is when you are conducting fact-checking interviews with additional people, such as subject-matter experts. In this case, the expert should understand that the fact-checking call is being conducted on background: they are helping you with your work, not being interviewed for the story itself.)\nNo matter what agreement the reporter made with the interviewed source, at least two people in the office should know the identity of the source so that the publication can assess the credibility of the information they have provided. Even if someone's identity cannot be published, it should not be withheld from the fact checker and head of research. It is the reporter's responsibility to communicate this policy to the source before the interview starts.\nYou should conduct fact-checking calls with everyone except off-the-record sources (to whom no information should be attributed, so there should be no reason for their names to appear in the reporter's research package in the first place). When fact-checking with a source on background, not for attribution, or whose name is veiled, make sure to lay out the terms of the attribution agreement again at the start and confirm that this is what they agreed on with the reporter. They may be nervous about speaking with a fact checker, so it is often helpful to remind them that the fact-checking call is as confidential as the original interview.\nIt's possible for the same person to have provided some information on the record and other information on background, so it is also important to indicate to the source which details are attached to their name and which are not.\nThe checker should confirm that any veiled source has chosen their own pseudonym or identification\u2014ideally their first or middle name. When ensuring someone's anonymity\u2014because of a publication ban or for reasons of safety or privacy\u2014remember that simply removing their name from the story is rarely enough: the reporter should also remove identifying information of any sort, which can include their workplace, their age, their location, and a variety of other descriptors.\nAny reader of the story should understand based on the text which sources are veiled and why. If you notice a source in the story who is mentioned only by first name or what seems to be a pseudonym without any explanation in the research package (and no in-text explanation for the reader), ask the handling editor and reporter about it before contacting the source for fact-checking.\nForeign-Language Reporting\nIdeally, a story will be assigned to a fact checker who speaks the same language as the story's main sources. But it is sometimes the case that no such fact checker is available, which means the publication may need to hire an interpreter or translator to help with fact-checking. Typically, this will be arranged by the head of research, although in some cases the fact checker may also be responsible for finding their own translator.\nWe recommend working with an interpreter as follows:\nOnce you have found an interpreter, arrange a call with them to explain the fact-checking process, especially how to conduct fact-checking interviews. (You will essentially go briefly through every major point in the Verification and Investigation section of this chapter, though the interpreter won't be doing all the work involved.)\nCreate the interview documents and write questions for the sources in a story as usual. Then send the interview documents for any foreign-language source to the interpreter, who will translate the questions.\nThe interpreter will contact the sources directly and ask them the questions in a recorded interview. They will then translate the answers back into English and send you the interview recording, transcript, and translation, and you will use those translated answers as usual in your fact-checking. Include all records in your fact-checking folder .\nSend any documentary source that is in a foreign language to the interpreter and tell them which fact you're hoping to confirm with it. Ask them to verify that the fact is corroborated by the source and to explain how and why it is (if it is). They should translate the relevant parts of the text and send that information back to you. Save the resulting documents and exchanges.\nThe translator should not suggest corrections or be involved in the fact-checking process more generally. They should report to the fact checker, who will compile the information in the fact-checking folder and make the appropriate corrections and comments in the checking copy .\nStories about Crime and the Law\nWhile fact-checking, keep an eye out for legally sensitive issues (which may vary depending on your location and may require consulting a media lawyer).\nThe questions below provide a helpful baseline for identifying when special legal care may be required during fact-checking. They also underline the difficulty of fact-checking a story that touches on legal or criminal affairs\u2014often, we need to fact-check the absence of something (absence of a verdict, absence of a publication ban, etc.), which can take substantial investigative work.\nStress Test for Legally Sensitive Stories\nIs the article saying something about someone that could harm their reputation or cause them embarrassment?\nIf so, have you checked with them whether the statement is accurate and whether they have any response to it? If the statement is true and pertinent but they are reluctant to comment, have you confirmed it with other credible sources, and can you stand behind the statement's accuracy if challenged in court?\nIs the story accusing anyone of illegal behaviour?\nAlways request a fact-checking interview with someone being accused of a crime. Even indirect accusations or accusations made of minor characters in a story are important to flag. The fact that the accusation takes up only one line of text (and doesn't name the person directly) won't prevent them from accusing you of libel if you don't have evidence for the accusation against them.\nIf the story refers to criminal offences, do you know whether the accused has been charged or convicted?\nIf they have not been convicted, the published story should not state or imply that they committed the offence\u2014at least not without making it absolutely clear that this has not yet been determined in court.\nHas any legal decision, such as a conviction, been appealed?\nSomeone can be convicted and later acquitted on appeal\u2014and you should catch this during fact-checking if the reporter missed it. If you cannot access court documents yourself, you can always ask the lawyers involved in the case.\nDid the author or editor provide all necessary legal documents to support statements made in the piece (such as statements of fact, sentencing documents, or court transcripts)?\nTry to access these documents and read them carefully\u2014they can include details you would otherwise miss.\nIf the word alleged is being used, is it modifying the right word in a sentence?\nShe was charged with the alleged crimes is very different from She was allegedly charged with the crimes , which is also different from She allegedly committed the crimes . Make sure you know which placement is right in the context of the story.\nIf the article is referring to a case being tried in court, is there a publication ban in place?\nIf the story identifies someone who is involved in a court case, make sure their identity is not protected by a publication ban. Some criminal court cases mandate that the accused or the complainant (or both) not be identified publicly. This is common for sexual-assault cases in Canada, for example. If a complainant's identity is bound by a court-ordered publication ban, that ban cannot be circumvented even if the complainant says they want their name published in the story.\nLifting a publication ban usually requires a court order, so it's best to consult a media lawyer before deciding whether the name of a complainant whose identity is protected by a ban can be published in a journalistic story. When faced with questions of anonymity, speak with the head of research and the handling editor\u2014and suggest that the story be read by a lawyer.\nScientific Papers and Journal Articles\nWe discuss science fact-checking in further detail in Chapter Four . For now, we will just note that, in any domain, it is important to differentiate between articles that have been peer-reviewed and those that have not been. (You should be able to find this information in the \"About Us\" page of the journal the paper was published in.) The preference is always for peer-reviewed work, though of course a peer-reviewed article may still have errors.\nAlways read a scientific paper or journal article in full before citing it. If you cannot access a scholarly paper that you need for your research, feel free to email the study's author\u2014academics are usually willing to share their work with journalists (and to explain it). You can also call a relevant expert who wasn't involved in the paper and ask them to help you understand and assess it.\nData and Statistics\nGenerally, there are three questions to ask about data: (1) what the raw data represents and how it was collected, (2) how that data was subsequently interpreted and analyzed (for example, by the authors of a scientific paper), and (3) how the reporter represented and used the data in their story.\nFact checkers should be aware of 1 and 2, which we discuss in detail in Chapter Four . But their main responsibility is to check 3: Is the reporter representing the data properly based on its source? Answering this question requires knowing how to accurately read statements about numbers, data, and statistics and how to identify common red flags. The following list of guidelines should help.\nGuidelines for Reporting Accurately on Data and Statistics\nMake sure you understand what the number refers to.\nLanguage describing numbers should be as precise as possible to avoid ambiguity. For example, the statement There are 300,000 Ojibwe living in Canada and the United States can be understood in various ways depending on what the author meant by Ojibwe . Is the number based on First Nation membership, on reserve population, on survey self-identification, on language speakers, or on other data? You won't be able to check the statement's accuracy until you know how to make it more precise.\nUse common sense.\nThis important piece of advice comes from Brooke Borel's The Chicago Guide to Fact-Checking. Asking yourself explicitly whether a number in a story makes sense can help you catch obvious (but common) errors. \"Say you're fact-checking a story that cites distances that came from a report that was written in a European country,\" Borel writes. \"Were the measurements correctly converted from kilometers to miles? Or say a story claims that 8 billion people have purchased the latest smartphone. As of 2016, the world population was around 7 billion. Did the writer mean 8 million?\"\nMake sure no crucial qualifying information is missing.\nMissing contextual information can make statements about numbers misleading, even if the numbers themselves are correct. For example, when the Washington Post tweeted an article in October 2020 saying that one volunteer in an Oxford coronavirus vaccine trial had died, the number was accurate, but the statement implied something inaccurate: the volunteer had been in the control group , meaning their death could not have been related to the vaccine.\nMake sure that approximations are appropriate.\nAn approximation can be accurate but misleading\u2014and that's cause for a correction. For example, the statement Less than 10 percent of COVID-19 transmissions have taken place outdoors would technically have been true in May 2021, but the real proportion of COVID-19 transmissions that had taken place outdoors at that time was closer to 0.1 percent . Less than 10 percent is not a good approximation of 0.1 percent, so it should be corrected.\nMake comparatives explicit and include the absolute numbers.\nStatements that include comparatives such as more than are often imprecise, which can make them difficult to fact-check. Take this headline from the American Cancer Society: \"More Black Women Die from Breast Cancer Than Any Other Cancer.\" The word more implies that there is a comparison here\u2014but it's not clear at all what is being compared. The types of cancer? The races of cancer patients? The death rates?\nFact checkers should look for answers in the absolute numbers. Further reading in the American Cancer Society report tells us that, in the US, Black women are more likely to die from breast cancer than white women, even though white women are more likely to receive a diagnosis of breast cancer than Black women. What's more, lung cancer has long been the leading cause of cancer death across the US, but since the number of lung cancer deaths has been in steep decline in recent years, in 2019, breast cancer became the leading cause of cancer death for Black women in particular.\nProviding this information in your fact-checking correction will allow the author and handling editor to rewrite the sentence in a way that emphasizes the fact they actually meant to communicate.\nCheck every instance of \"percent\" and \"percentage point.\"\nWhen discussing an increase or decrease in percentages, it can be easy to trip over language; always ask yourself whether the right terminology is being used.\nA percent change refers to a number's relative change. For example, if I ate 50 chocolate bars last year, and I ate 70 this year, then my chocolate bar consumption increased 40 percent from year to year.\nA percentage-point change describes an absolute change in percentages . Say 10 out of the 50 chocolate bars I ate last year had nuts in them; that's 20 percent with nuts. This year, I still ate only 10 bars with nuts, but since I ate 70 bars in total, that's only about 14 percent with nuts. That means my nut-chocolate-bar consumption rate decreased from 20 to about 14 percent\u2014so it decreased roughly 6 percentage points and 30 percent. (My annual absolute nutty chocolate-bar consumption, however, remained unchanged: I ate 10 a year.)\nProperly differentiate between causation and correlation.\nCorrelation between two variables means that they have some kind of relationship\u2014as one variable changes, so does the other. Causation is more precise: it means that one variable's changes cause the other to change. Not all correlation is causation, and you should make sure that the right vocabulary is being used (or implied) in a reporter's work.\nOne famous example of correlation draws on criminology research: strangely enough, whenever ice cream sales increase in a region, so does the violent crime rate\u2014the two numbers are correlated. But that does not mean ice cream sales cause violent crime or vice versa. Rather, the correlation probably comes from the fact that, when it's warm out, people eat more ice cream, and they also spend more time outside, increasing the likelihood that they will encounter crime. This is an example of correlation that does not imply causation.\nPay particular attention to the use of statistical and technical language.\nScientists and statisticians may describe a result as \"significant\" or \"non-significant,\" they may refer to its \"p-value,\" or they may use other language with precise statistical meanings. The best way to check whether the reporter has conveyed such facts accurately is to refer to the original report where the language came from (most scientific papers will include helpful explanations of what the numbers mean)\u2014or even to speak with one of the authors. Since p-values are particularly contentious in some scientific circles, Borel suggests that, \"when in doubt, a fact-checker should call a statistician to help identify whether a paper is using the p-value honestly and correctly.\"\nIf any of these examples feels overwhelming, don't worry\u2014what's most important is that you can identify potential problems, even if you can't solve them on your own. You can always ask colleagues for help sorting through numbers and statistical statements, or you can call an expert on background for advice.\nAfter the Fact-Check\nFact-checking a story can take anywhere from one day to one month (and even longer for books and other longform works); it depends on a variety of factors, including the availability of sources for interviews and the complexity of the topic at hand.\nOnce you're satisfied that you've finished your work and you have a fact-checking folder and checking copy ready to go, you can let the head of research know that you're ready for a top read.\nTop Read\nTypically, the top read happens after the fact-checking folder and checking copy are complete and before any corrections have been input into the story. The top reader can be anyone qualified to assess the work, usually another fact checker or the head of research (but not the handling editor or the reporter, whose proximity to the story may prevent them from making accurate assessments of the fact check).\nThe point of the top read is to lend a fresh set of eyes to the fact-checked piece to make sure that nothing was missed by the fact checker. Together, the top reader and fact checker go over the checking copy and fact-checking folder. The top reader checks that every fact has been accounted for, assesses the kinds of sources used, ensures that the fact checker's comments are clear, and checks for proper formatting. They can also provide a second opinion on any parts the fact checker found particularly challenging\nThe top reader does not need to recheck the entire story or go through every source; they usually focus on areas that are most likely to be controversial or prone to error. Usually, a top reader is more thorough on the first few pages, to get an idea of the fact check, and then they use their judgment for the rest of the story. The top reader will often ask the fact checker clarificatory questions: \"How do we know this?\"; \"Are you sure this source is appropriate and credible?\"; \"Have we followed up with the original source about this?\" By the time you have finished your fact check and entered the top read stage, you should be ready to answer these questions; if not, your fact-checking work is not complete.\nThe length of the top read depends on the length and complexity of the piece, but it usually takes a couple of hours. At the end, the top reader gives the fact checker a list of statements and sources to follow up on and questions to answer\u2014usually minor clarifications that they will have to investigate or rectify in their checked copy, sometimes more substantial revisions. (It's very rare that the top reader will have no comments or follow-ups to suggest\u2014just like it's very rare that the fact checker will have no corrections to suggest. We're all human!) This list of follow-ups should be saved in the fact-checking folder for the publication's records.\nThe fact checker completes the top reader's follow-ups and adjusts their fact-checking folder and checking copy appropriately. Then they're ready for input.\nFact-Check Input\nOnce the fact check is complete, the fact checker builds the checked copy . This is a version of the checking copy from which all source annotations have been removed\u2014only corrections, clarifications, and other notes for the editor should remain. (This is because the handling editor does not need to know sourcing details for any fact that has been confirmed; they are concerned only with the details that require changes.)\nThe fact checker sends the checked copy to the handling editor and lets them know that they are ready for fact-check input . Typically, the editor will meet with the fact checker or speak with them over the phone, and the two will walk through every comment in the piece. This is the fact checker's opportunity to explain why certain\u00a0changes need to be made and help the editor decide on accurate modifications to the text. The fact checker and the editor note what has been changed and how in order to record the changes in the fact-checking folder. We recommend doing so by creating a duplicate of the checked copy, called the post-input copy , where every change made by the editor is highlighted. Save the post-input copy in the fact-checking folder.\nDuring input, the handling editor may decide that a suggested correction isn't necessary; if you agree, then that correction can be stetted \u2014which essentially means that it has been overridden. In your input copy, make sure to note which changes are made and which are stetted. Speak up to editors if they override a correction that you believe is necessary. If there is a disagreement, make sure you've provided the editor with all of the information that has led you to believe a correction must be made. If you and the handling editor can't come to an agreement, the head of research will step in and make the final decision.\nOnce fact-check input is complete, the story is out of your hands: the handling editor will send the fact-checked version back to the reporter for the sake of transparency (and perhaps to ask for further modifications, if appropriate), and the story will enter production. If any changes are made to the story after that point, you may be called on to fact-check new details ( ideally nothing major at this late point in the editorial process). Make sure to include any additions in your fact-checking folder.\nFact-Check Read\nYou will see the story at least one more time after fact-check input, during your fact-check read . This is a chance for you to read the final draft of the story, after it has been copy-edited, formatted, proofread, and all the rest. You don't need to go through the entire fact-check again; just read the story to ensure that everything still seems accurate. Double-check anything new or suspicious, and input any changes with the handling editor. Keep a record of your work (including any new sources, corrections, and inputs or stets ) in your fact-checking folder. Once your fact-check read is complete, your job is done, and your fact-checking folder is saved to the publication's archive. Congratulations! The story is ready for publication.\nVariations and Adapting to Constraints\nThe fact-checking methodology outlined in this chapter sets a high standard, which not every publication can meet given limited resources and time. Fact-checking thoroughly can take a huge amount of time and energy, which makes it incompatible with the constraints of daily journalism and the small size of most newsrooms today. Daily newsrooms lack the time to conduct a thorough fact-check on every breaking story before publishing it. But this doesn't mean that no fact-checking is possible. Below, we highlight some of the compromises publications have made in order to allow for some kind of fact-checking process\u2014even if it doesn't meet the ideal we've described.\nWhatever version of editorial fact-checking a publication adopts, if the modifications made to the process introduce caveats to the reliability of the published content or affect how readers should relate to it\u2014for example, if only certain stories or kinds of facts are ever checked, or if sources aren't given the opportunity to confirm their quotes\u2014then these modifications should be disclosed publicly. This transparency can look different in different contexts. Sometimes, it makes sense to acknowledge that a story was fact-checked differently from the standard within the text of the story itself; other times, a publication can inform readers about its fact-checking methodology in its house policy or ethics statements. The important thing is to ensure that, when a story is described as \"fact-checked,\" we all agree on what that means, and we know when and why exceptions to that definition have been made.\nWe have categorized the variations below by which ones we think should be disclosed to the reader if the publication is claiming to publish fact-checked journalism. All publications should have responsive and rigorous corrections policies and an open line of communication with sources and their audience.\nModifications that do not need to be disclosed:\nNo head of research or fact-checking department\nMost publications that are not heavily invested in fact-checking do not have a separate fact-checking department or full-time head of research . That doesn't necessarily mean they don't work with fact checkers\u2014but, when they do, there may be no one overseeing the fact checkers' work full-time, and the fact checkers may be freelancers hired to work on individual stories at a time. In these cases, the fact checker typically works directly with the handling editor on the story, and any complications are sorted out between them, without any outside review process. The more review there can be of fact checkers' work, the better\u2014-especially for decisions about source accommodations and disagreements between the fact checker and the reporter or handling editor.\nNo review steps\nA publication may decide to omit the review of the research package and/or the top read from their editorial process in order to save time and resources. If this is the case, we recommend that the fact checker reread their final check with an eye to those smaller details.\nFact-checking and editing at the same time\nSome publications send a piece into fact-checking before the final draft is ready and continue to edit the story while fact-checking is underway. We advise against this as it creates more work for the fact checker: they have to keep track of what information has already been corroborated and what new information needs verification. This situation makes it much more likely that important details will be missed and errors will be published. If possible, the handling editor should wait for the most final version of a piece possible before sending it into fact-checking. If fact-checking needs to happen simultaneously, make sure to keep detailed records and ensure that every fact (including the most recent additions) has been checked before the story is published.\nModifications that should likely be disclosed to sources and the audience:\nUsing audio recordings and transcripts instead of calling people back\nA publication with a tight schedule and few fact checkers on staff may rely on interview audio recordings and transcripts instead of calling people back. Doing this is of course better than not checking quotes at all, but it prevents the fact checker from updating sources' quotes with new information or accounting for missed context or nuance in the reporter's presentation of the quote. This practice is generally inadvisable: the fact checker's responsibility to call every interviewed source in a story is one of the most important parts of the job (as we emphasize in Chapter Eight .\nIf this is your publication's policy, make sure that interviewed sources know about it in advance so that they can consent to their interview being recorded and transcribed and to those transcriptions serving as an official record. You may still need to follow up if any clarificatory questions arise during your fact-checking that cannot be answered by reading through the transcript.\nGiving some stories \"light checks\"\nSometimes, editors, publishers, or reporters ask for a story to be given a \"light\" check. This may mean that they want you to look only at the spellings of proper nouns and any dates or figures. Or it may mean that they want you to contact only sources who are seen as important. Standards vary, but many publications assign what they consider to be light checks for the sake of resource management.\nFor example, you might be asked to fact-check a memoir that has to be rushed for web publication without verifying the facts that involve the author's personal experience. Or, when fact-checking a book review under a tight deadline, you might trust that the author has understood the gist of the book without having to look at it yourself. (If fact-checking must be rushed, a preferable way to approach such a story would be to contact the book's author or publisher and confirm details about the book over the phone instead of reading it in full.) In these cases, you should be pragmatic: prioritize the most important and controversial details.\nIt is up to you to identify which kinds of \"light check\" modifications need to be disclosed; most of the time, they do.\nFact-checking only certain stories\nTo cut costs and save time, some publications fact-check only certain stories\u2014typically those submitted by freelance reporters (instead of staff reporters), those published in print (instead of online), or those that are especially controversial or legally sensitive (in order to avoid lawsuits).\nHere, transparency is key. If this policy is not disclosed to readers, then the audience will not be empowered to properly assess and compare the publication's stories, which are not all being held to the same factual standard.\nThe copy editor as fact checker\nSome publications do not hire fact checkers but still claim to publish fact-checked journalism because they ask the copy editor to do the job. When fact-checking falls to the copy editor, it usually means that the fact check can't be done as thoroughly as it would be by someone whose role was dedicated to checking.\nIdeally, the copy editor maintains some separation between copy-editing and fact-checking, and they call sources back (or at least listen to interview recordings) and conduct background research. But, when publications have this arrangement, the copy editor is often asked to check only the facts that fall under the copy editor's domains, such as name spellings and dates. In these cases, they can't really be called a fact checker according to the standards of this guide\u2014and this should certainly be disclosed to readers and sources.\nThe reporter as fact checker\u2014or no fact checker at all\nMany publications do not have the resources to employ fact checkers, especially in the world of daily news, where there is no time for a second person to go through a reporter's work before it is published\u2014though editors may do some checking of their own for legally or otherwise sensitive stories.\nThough we do not recommend that the reporter fact-check their own work, since mistakes are likely to be missed, this is of course preferable to there being no fact-check at all. At the very least, reporters should be supported and given the resources to fact-check their own reporting before it is published. And any publication that does not support any kind of fact-checking process should not claim to publish fact-checked journalism.\nWhat's Next?\nNow you know what we consider to be the ideal methodology for fact-checking a piece of journalism. If you are interested in learning more about the standard practice, we advise reading the helpful guides by Cynthia Brouse ( After the Fact: A Guide to Fact-Checking for Magazines and Other Media ), Sarah Harrison Smith ( The Fact Checker's Bible: A Guide to Getting It Right ), and Brooke Borel ( The Chicago Guide to Fact-Checking ). The Knight Science Journalism Program at MIT also has a variety of helpful resources online for learning and teaching editorial fact-checking.\nIn the following chapters, we focus on topics that previously published fact-checking guides have not covered: the cases where ethical and other considerations make straightforward fact-checking counterproductive or impossible. These considerations won't come up for every fact check\u2014it's unlikely that you will need to navigate trauma-informed interviewing practices or address systemic oppression while fact-checking a 250-word article on toothpaste. But the rest of this guide should help you think through complicated ethical issues if and when they do come up in your work; help you be more informed and capable of advocating for factual accuracy in future conversations with your editorial colleagues; and help you identify when standard practices need to be questioned or reconsidered.\n\u00a9 Allison Baker and Viviane Fairbank 2022\n2.

Wire\nUSA TODAY Show Caption\nHide Caption\nTrump tells Zelenskyy to leave after heated Oval Office clash President Trump and Zelenskyy got in a heated exchange in the Oval Office as peace talks fall apart. WASHINGTON \u2013\u00a0As soon as Ukrainian President\u00a0 Volodymyr Zelenskyy \u00a0emerged out of his motorcade at the West Wing,\u00a0 President Donald Trump \u00a0immediately took a dig at his clothes. Outfitted in a black sweatshirt featuring an embroidered Ukrainian trident, black slacks and boots, he was substantially underdressed in comparison to Trump, who was wearing a suit and tie. \u201cYou\u2019re all dressed up today,\u201d Trump said sarcastically. It all quickly went downhill from there. After a heated exchange in the Oval Office, Zelenskyy would later depart without signing an \u201ceconomic partnership\u201d deal he had travelled 5,000 miles to seal. Zelenskyy, whose country was invaded by Russia three years ago, has been a known casual dresser. He often favors olive green crewnecks with cargo pants and combat boots, a signal to the world that his country is still at war. In December, he wore a similar outfit for the\u00a0reopening ceremony of the Notre Dame cathedral \u00a0in Paris as well as for his meeting with then President-elect Trump and French President Emmanuel\u00a0Macron at \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace. During his t\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eate with Trump in the Oval Office, Brian Glenn, White House correspondent for the pro-Trump network Real America\u2019s Voice, asked Zelenskyy why he was not wearing a suit while visiting the \u201chighest level\u201d office in the country. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you wear a suit?,\u201d he said. \u201cA lot of Americans have problems with you not respecting the office.\u201d Zelenskyy said he\u2019ll \u201cwear the costume after the war is finished.\" Kostium is the Ukrainian word for suit. Then he told the reporter: \u201cMaybe I\u2019ll wear something like yours or something better,\u201d eliciting laughter. \u201cMaybe something cheaper.\u201d A correspondent for TASS, a Russian state media organization, was also a part of the 'pool' of reporters given access to the Oval Office on Friday to cover the sit down \u2013 even as the AP and Reuters were barred from the high-level meeting. \u201cTASS was not on the approved list of media for today\u2019s pool,\u201d a White House official told CNN in a statement . \u201cAs soon as it came to the attention of press office staff that he was in the Oval, he was escorted out by the Press Secretary.\u201d The White House recently announced that it will now control media access to the president, rather than the decades old tradition of a coalition of news agencies determining who gets to cover the president. 'You don't have the cards right now' Minutes later, the meeting devolved into a shouting match between Vice President JD Vance , Trump and Zelenskyy. The U.S. president and vice president said Zelenskyy was not grateful for American support for Ukraine. The conversation became particularly charged when Trump said the Ukrainian president was prolonging the war while being in a weak diplomatic position and using American resources. \u201cYou don\u2019t have the cards right now. You're gambling with the lives of millions of people. You're gambling with World War III,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWhat you're doing is very disrespectful to the country that's backed you.\u201d Soon after, a planned lunch and a bilateral meeting was canceled and Zelenskyy was seen leaving the White House. A White House official told USA Today that Zelenskyy was asked to leave . The deal he had come to sign, giving America access to rare earths in his country , was left on the table. Trump has demanded access to rare minerals as a compensation for the billions of dollars Congress has appropriated for American military support and aid. Zelenskyy had insisted on coming to Washington to sign the agreement, expecting to use the opportunity to push Trump to commit to future military support. \"He disrespected the United States of America in its cherished Oval Office. He can come back when he is ready for Peace,\"\u00a0 Trump said in a statement . Trump told reporters he was not interested in talking with Zelenskyy again unless the Ukrainian leader was ready to end the bloodshed. \u201cHe\u2019s looking for something that I\u2019m not looking for. He\u2019s looking to go on and fight, fight, fight,\" Trump said later. \"We\u2019re looking to end the death.\u201d U.S. Sen. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) criticized Trump's \"shameful display\" in a video posted on YouTube. \"Is this now what America is? We are reduced to some kind of extortionary protectionist racket, where a leader of a country whose citizens have fought and died valiantly standing up to a Kremlin dictator is so abused, where we stand for nothing but using our might to extort the weak or the vulnerable?\" Schiff said. \"Is this where we are right now? Because this is what we witnessed in the Oval Office today.\" Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) called it a \"spectacle which should shame every American.\" \"These are people who bully anybody they perceive to be in a weaker position,\" Van Hollen said on Twitter . \"But Zelenskyy has something neither of them have. He has courage and he has principle.\" Zelenskyy said in\u00a0 a Fox News interview \u00a0Friday that he came to the United States because he wants peace, too. \"Americans are the best of our friends. Europeans are the best of our friends. Putin with Russia, they're enemies, Zelenskyy told Fox News. \"And it doesn't mean that we don't want peace. We just want to recognize the reality, the real situation.\" Prodded repeatedly by host Bret Baier, Zelenskyy thanked Americans for their support but declined to apologize. \"No, I respect the president and I respect American people... I think that we have to be very open and very honest, and I'm not sure that we did something bad,\" he said. European nations jumped to defend Zelenskyy and Ukraine in the hours after the altercation, and Zelenskyy received a different welcome Saturday in the United Kingdom. \"You have full backing across the United Kingdom, and we stand with you, with Ukraine, for as long as it may take,\" Prime Minister Keir Starmer said.

Zelensky has eschewed suits, button-down shirts and ties - even during important meetings with world leaders and an address to the US Congress - since the start of the full-scale Russian invasion of his country began in 2022. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement The Ukrainian leader has said his choice of clothing is a show of solidarity with soldiers fighting the Russian army on the war's frontlines. But it has long been an irritant for some critics of US aid to Ukraine, and after years as a talking point in right-wing media circles, the issue came to global attention in a spectacular way during Friday's now infamous Oval Office meeting with Trump and US Vice-President JD Vance. A question to Zelensky from a reporter accused him of disrespecting the occasion by not wearing a suit and this immediately changed the atmosphere in the room, according to BBC reporters present. And a short time later, larger issues of respect and gratitude fuelled the extraordinary argument that saw the US president and vice-president upbraid their European ally in front of the world's TV cameras. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement European leaders back Zelensky after Trump clash How the Trump-Zelensky talks collapsed in 10 fiery minutes Zelensky wants US to 'stand more firmly' on Ukraine's side When the meeting was opened up to questions from reporters, one came from Brian Glenn, chief White House correspondent for conservative cable network Real America's Voice. \"Why don't you wear a suit?\" Glenn asked. \"You're at the highest level in this country's office, and you refuse to wear a suit. \"Do you own a suit?\" he continued. \"A lot of Americans have problems with you not respecting the dignity of this office.\" The aggressive questioning marked the moment when the Ukrainian president \u2013 who until then seemed to be having a diplomatic, even friendly, conversation with Trump \u2013 first appeared tired and irritated. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement \"I will wear costume after this war will finish,\" Zelensky replied. (The word \"suit\" can be translated into Ukrainian as \"kostyum\".) The Ukrainian president then made a verbal jab at the reporter. \"Maybe something like yours, yes. Maybe something better, I don't know,\" he said, to laughter in the room. \"Maybe something cheaper.\" 'Trump and Vance were so rude': Ukrainians react to disastrous White House meeting Most Republicans laud Trump after Zelensky showdown, but some express dismay Glenn's question gave voice to a longstanding gripe in the world of Make America Great Again (Maga) politics, where some - like JD Vance - argue that the Ukrainian leader does not seem to be showing enough gratitude or respect to the US for three years of military aid. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement A former local TV reporter in Dallas who became better known in conservative circles for his work at another pro-Trump channel, Right Side Broadcasting Network, Glenn is an unabashed Trump fan. Last year he told Politico that he was \"100 percent behind President Trump and the America First agenda.\" He is also reportedly dating Marjorie Taylor Greene, the Georgia congresswoman who is one of Trump's most outspoken supporters. Glenn was in the room as part of the White House press pool, a group of reporters which covers the president at official events on behalf of the wider media. The Trump administration took control of the pool this week from an association of journalists, saying it would give more access to \"new voices\". It has continued to bar the Associated Press from the pool. Glenn and Greene pictured in Washington last year [Getty Images] Real America's Voice, which was founded in 2020, is a relatively obscure right-wing cable news outlet, one of several pro-Trump channels that have cropped up in recent years. Its guests and hosts have spread conspiracy theories about a variety of subjects, including the 2020 presidential election, the 2021 Capitol riot and QAnon. Advertisement Advertisement Its show line-up includes some big names from the Maga world, including Trump's former chief advisor Steve Bannon, classic rocker turned political activist Ted Nugent and Charlie Kirk, the founder of the conservative Turning Point group. The BBC contacted the network for comment. After the Oval Office spat, Glenn posted online that he had \"extreme empathy for the people of Ukraine\" but said that Zelensky's lack of a suit demonstrated \"his inner disrespect\" for the US. Zelensky's defenders online posted pictures of Winston Churchill wearing casual clothes during World War Two. Pictures from the period show the British leader wearing jumpsuit-like clothes to a meeting with then-US President Franklin Roosevelt, and he also wore military uniforms and suits during conflabs with world leaders. Churchill wore a one-piece suit - which he called a 'siren suit' after the warning horns which signalled a German air raid - to the White House in the midst of the Second World War [Central Press/Hulton Archive/Getty Images] After Glenn's question, the news conference swiftly moved on, to a query about whether the US would send more arms to Ukraine. At the end of an answer Trump referred back to the suit question.

US news outlet Axios reported that before the meeting, White House staffers had requested that Zelensky wear a suit and were offended when he did not. However, the two world leaders continued taking questions, more or less cordially, for nearly another 20 minutes before the extraordinary argument broke out, after an interruption by the US vice-president, JD Vance. Vance repeatedly brought up \"respect\" \u2013 referring to Zelensky as \"Mr President\" as the Ukrainian leader called him \"JD\" \u2013 and said: \"I think it's disrespectful for you to come into the Oval Office and try to litigate this in front of the American media right now\".

Wire\nUSA TODAY Show Caption\nHide Caption\nTrump tells Zelenskyy to leave after heated Oval Office clash President Trump and Zelenskyy got in a heated exchange in the Oval Office as peace talks fall apart. WASHINGTON \u2013\u00a0As soon as Ukrainian President\u00a0 Volodymyr Zelenskyy \u00a0emerged out of his motorcade at the West Wing,\u00a0 President Donald Trump \u00a0immediately took a dig at his clothes. Outfitted in a black sweatshirt featuring an embroidered Ukrainian trident, black slacks and boots, he was substantially underdressed in comparison to Trump, who was wearing a suit and tie. \u201cYou\u2019re all dressed up today,\u201d Trump said sarcastically. It all quickly went downhill from there. After a heated exchange in the Oval Office, Zelenskyy would later depart without signing an \u201ceconomic partnership\u201d deal he had travelled 5,000 miles to seal. Zelenskyy, whose country was invaded by Russia three years ago, has been a known casual dresser. He often favors olive green crewnecks with cargo pants and combat boots, a signal to the world that his country is still at war. In December, he wore a similar outfit for the\u00a0reopening ceremony of the Notre Dame cathedral \u00a0in Paris as well as for his meeting with then President-elect Trump and French President Emmanuel\u00a0Macron at \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace. During his t\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eate with Trump in the Oval Office, Brian Glenn, White House correspondent for the pro-Trump network Real America\u2019s Voice, asked Zelenskyy why he was not wearing a suit while visiting the \u201chighest level\u201d office in the country. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you wear a suit?,\u201d he said. \u201cA lot of Americans have problems with you not respecting the office.\u201d Zelenskyy said he\u2019ll \u201cwear the costume after the war is finished.\" Kostium is the Ukrainian word for suit. Then he told the reporter: \u201cMaybe I\u2019ll wear something like yours or something better,\u201d eliciting laughter. \u201cMaybe something cheaper.\u201d A correspondent for TASS, a Russian state media organization, was also a part of the 'pool' of reporters given access to the Oval Office on Friday to cover the sit down \u2013 even as the AP and Reuters were barred from the high-level meeting. \u201cTASS was not on the approved list of media for today\u2019s pool,\u201d a White House official told CNN in a statement . \u201cAs soon as it came to the attention of press office staff that he was in the Oval, he was escorted out by the Press Secretary.\u201d The White House recently announced that it will now control media access to the president, rather than the decades old tradition of a coalition of news agencies determining who gets to cover the president.

The U.S. president and vice president said Zelenskyy was not grateful for American support for Ukraine. The conversation became particularly charged when Trump said the Ukrainian president was prolonging the war while being in a weak diplomatic position and using American resources. \u201cYou don\u2019t have the cards right now. You're gambling with the lives of millions of people. You're gambling with World War III,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWhat you're doing is very disrespectful to the country that's backed you.\u201d Soon after, a planned lunch and a bilateral meeting was canceled and Zelenskyy was seen leaving the White House. A White House official told USA Today that Zelenskyy was asked to leave . The deal he had come to sign, giving America access to rare earths in his country , was left on the table. Trump has demanded access to rare minerals as a compensation for the billions of dollars Congress has appropriated for American military support and aid. Zelenskyy had insisted on coming to Washington to sign the agreement, expecting to use the opportunity to push Trump to commit to future military support. \"He disrespected the United States of America in its cherished Oval Office. He can come back when he is ready for Peace,\"\u00a0 Trump said in a statement . Trump told reporters he was not interested in talking with Zelenskyy again unless the Ukrainian leader was ready to end the bloodshed. \u201cHe\u2019s looking for something that I\u2019m not looking for. He\u2019s looking to go on and fight, fight, fight,\" Trump said later. \"We\u2019re looking to end the death.\u201d U.S. Sen. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) criticized Trump's \"shameful display\" in a video posted on YouTube. \"Is this now what America is? We are reduced to some kind of extortionary protectionist racket, where a leader of a country whose citizens have fought and died valiantly standing up to a Kremlin dictator is so abused, where we stand for nothing but using our might to extort the weak or the vulnerable?\" Schiff said. \"Is this where we are right now?

Zelensky has eschewed suits, button-down shirts and ties - even during important meetings with world leaders and an address to the US Congress - since the start of the full-scale Russian invasion of his country began in 2022. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement The Ukrainian leader has said his choice of clothing is a show of solidarity with soldiers fighting the Russian army on the war's frontlines. But it has long been an irritant for some critics of US aid to Ukraine, and after years as a talking point in right-wing media circles, the issue came to global attention in a spectacular way during Friday's now infamous Oval Office meeting with Trump and US Vice-President JD Vance. A question to Zelensky from a reporter accused him of disrespecting the occasion by not wearing a suit and this immediately changed the atmosphere in the room, according to BBC reporters present. And a short time later, larger issues of respect and gratitude fuelled the extraordinary argument that saw the US president and vice-president upbraid their European ally in front of the world's TV cameras. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement European leaders back Zelensky after Trump clash How the Trump-Zelensky talks collapsed in 10 fiery minutes Zelensky wants US to 'stand more firmly' on Ukraine's side When the meeting was opened up to questions from reporters, one came from Brian Glenn, chief White House correspondent for conservative cable network Real America's Voice. \"Why don't you wear a suit?\" Glenn asked. \"You're at the highest level in this country's office, and you refuse to wear a suit. \"Do you own a suit?\" he continued. \"A lot of Americans have problems with you not respecting the dignity of this office.\" The aggressive questioning marked the moment when the Ukrainian president \u2013 who until then seemed to be having a diplomatic, even friendly, conversation with Trump \u2013 first appeared tired and irritated. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement \"I will wear costume after this war will finish,\" Zelensky replied. (The word \"suit\" can be translated into Ukrainian as \"kostyum\".) The Ukrainian president then made a verbal jab at the reporter. \"Maybe something like yours, yes. Maybe something better, I don't know,\" he said, to laughter in the room. \"Maybe something cheaper.\" 'Trump and Vance were so rude': Ukrainians react to disastrous White House meeting Most Republicans laud Trump after Zelensky showdown, but some express dismay Glenn's question gave voice to a longstanding gripe in the world of Make America Great Again (Maga) politics, where some - like JD Vance - argue that the Ukrainian leader does not seem to be showing enough gratitude or respect to the US for three years of military aid. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement A former local TV reporter in Dallas who became better known in conservative circles for his work at another pro-Trump channel, Right Side Broadcasting Network, Glenn is an unabashed Trump fan. Last year he told Politico that he was \"100 percent behind President Trump and the America First agenda.\" He is also reportedly dating Marjorie Taylor Greene, the Georgia congresswoman who is one of Trump's most outspoken supporters. Glenn was in the room as part of the White House press pool, a group of reporters which covers the president at official events on behalf of the wider media. The Trump administration took control of the pool this week from an association of journalists, saying it would give more access to \"new voices\". It has continued to bar the Associated Press from the pool. Glenn and Greene pictured in Washington last year [Getty Images] Real America's Voice, which was founded in 2020, is a relatively obscure right-wing cable news outlet, one of several pro-Trump channels that have cropped up in recent years. Its guests and hosts have spread conspiracy theories about a variety of subjects, including the 2020 presidential election, the 2021 Capitol riot and QAnon. Advertisement Advertisement Its show line-up includes some big names from the Maga world, including Trump's former chief advisor Steve Bannon, classic rocker turned political activist Ted Nugent and Charlie Kirk, the founder of the conservative Turning Point group. The BBC contacted the network for comment. After the Oval Office spat, Glenn posted online that he had \"extreme empathy for the people of Ukraine\" but said that Zelensky's lack of a suit demonstrated \"his inner disrespect\" for the US. Zelensky's defenders online posted pictures of Winston Churchill wearing casual clothes during World War Two. Pictures from the period show the British leader wearing jumpsuit-like clothes to a meeting with then-US President Franklin Roosevelt, and he also wore military uniforms and suits during conflabs with world leaders. Churchill wore a one-piece suit - which he called a 'siren suit' after the warning horns which signalled a German air raid - to the White House in the midst of the Second World War [Central Press/Hulton Archive/Getty Images] After Glenn's question, the news conference swiftly moved on, to a query about whether the US would send more arms to Ukraine. At the end of an answer Trump referred back to the suit question. Advertisement Advertisement \"I do like your clothing,\" he quipped, and pointing to Zelensky he said, \"I think he's dressed beautifully.\" Behind the scenes, Trump's attitude may have been slightly different, according to reports. US news outlet Axios reported that before the meeting, White House staffers had requested that Zelensky wear a suit and were offended when he did not. However, the two world leaders continued taking questions, more or less cordially, for nearly another 20 minutes before the extraordinary argument broke out, after an interruption by the US vice-president, JD Vance. Vance repeatedly brought up \"respect\" \u2013 referring to Zelensky as \"Mr President\" as the Ukrainian leader called him \"JD\" \u2013 and said: \"I think it's disrespectful for you to come into the Oval Office and try to litigate this in front of the American media right now\". Advertisement Advertisement The discussion went downhill from there. A suit-less Zelensky was soon ejected from the White House, as relations between the two countries reached a new wartime low.

You're at the highest level in this country's office and you refuse to wear a suit. Do you own a suit? 'A lot of Americans have problems, with you not respecting the dignity of this office,' Glenn - who is the partner of Congresswoman and close Trump ally Marjorie Taylor Greene - added.\u00a0 Responding to the criticism,\u00a0the Ukrainian leader, who is often seen wearing casual combat clothes since Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022, said he faced more pressing problems with the war in Europe. He added that he 'will wear a kostium (Ukrainian for 'suit') after this war will finish' and it would be 'maybe something like yours, maybe something better, maybe something cheaper'.\u00a0 In a sign of support towards Zelensky, before the meeting escalated into a tense war of words, Trump quickly came to his aid and defended the president's clothing.\u00a0 'I do like your clothing by the way,' Trump said. 'I don't know if you two like each other, but I think he (Zelensky) is dressed beautifully.' President Donald Trump meets with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in the Oval Office of the White House in Washington During the meeting\u00a0Brian Glenn (pictured), Chief White House Correspondent Real America's Voice, asked why Zelensky didn't wear a suit Trump's comments appeared to contradict reports that the US President was actually irritated by Zelensky's attire. Advisers had urged the Ukrainian leader to wear a suit as a sign of respect when visiting the White House, sources told Axios. And when Zelensky first arrived at the entrance to the West Wing, dressed in an all black outfit and jumper emblazoned with the Ukrainian trident, Trump appeared to mock him. 'He is all dressed up today,' the President said as he shook\u00a0Zelensky's hand.\u00a0 The criticism by Glenn, who was one of several pro-Trump journalists invited into the White House Press pool after the President's inauguration, was echoed by his partner Ms Greene. She wrote on X shortly after the exchange: 'I\u2019m so proud of for pointing out that Zelensky has so much disrespect for America that he can\u2019t even wear a suit in the Oval Office when he comes to beg for money from our President!!' Others on social media also pointed out that when Elon Musk visited the Oval Office with Trump last month, he too did not wear a suit.\u00a0 Zelensky has faced similar criticism in the past for his choice of outfits while attending major meetings with other world leaders.\u00a0 Brian Glenn is the boyfriend of\u00a0of Congresswoman and close Trump ally Marjorie Taylor Greene. The pair are pictured together at a pro-Trump rally in November, 2024 Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky was criticised heavily in America for turning up to the White House in 2022 looking like a 'strip club manager' as he wore casual combat clothes Volodymyr Zelensky addresses a joint meeting of Congress in the House Chamber of the U.S. Capitol on December 21, 2022\nIn 2022, following Zelensky's address to the US Congress, Commentator Tucker Carlson accused the Ukrainian leader of dressing like the 'manager of a strip club demanding money'.\u00a0 Meanwhile supporters of Zelensky have instead compared him to the UK Prime Minister WInston Churchill, who notably also refused to wear a suit during a visit to the White House in the midst of World War Two.\u00a0 The British wartime leader wore an air-raid suit, which he referred to as his 'siren suit', during a visit to Washington DC to meet with President Franklin D Roosevelt in January 1942.\u00a0 Ironically there is also a bust of Churchill - who President Trump has described as his hero - in the Oval Office.\u00a0\u00a0 Zelensky had come to the US in an effort to try to gain security guarantees in a rare earth minerals deal that Trump says will provide a form of protection by putting U.S. business interests inside his country. During the meeting, Trump called on a U.S.-based Polish reporter who pressed him on the U.S. posture toward Russia. Trump called the question 'stupid'.\u00a0 Then later on in an exchange that lasted 50 minutes, Trump called on the same reporter \u2013 whose queries prompted Vance to say Ukraine had been ungrateful for billions in U.S. support. Vance blamed previous Democratic U.S. administrations for failing to stop Russia, but Zelensky tried to shift the conversation back to Putin. 'He killed people,' he said.\u00a0 Zelensky, who has said he will not wear suits until the war in Ukraine has ended, is seen wearing a jacket and black top during\u00a0a meeting at with French President and Trump at The Elysee Presidential Palace in Paris in December Zelensky worse a similar all black outfit during his latest meeting with Sir Keir Starmer in Downing Street in October When Elon Musk visited the Oval Office with Trump last month, he too did not wear a suit UK Prime Minister WInston Churchill notably also refused to wear a suit during a visit to the White House in the midst of World War Two 'What kind of diplomacy, JD, are you speaking about,' the Ukrainian asked, referring to Vance by his first name rather than his formal title.\u00a0 The remark set off Vance \u2013 who lectured Zelensky, and then got told off by the visitor for failing to visit Ukraine as a senator, even while many others made the pilgrimage. 'I'm talking about the kind of diplomacy that's going to end the destruction of your country, Mr. President [Zelensky].\u00a0 'Mr. President, with respect. I think it's disrespectful for you to come to the Oval Office to try to litigate this in front of the American media,' said Vance. 'Have you ever been to Ukraine that you see the problems we have?' Zelensky asked Vance, who last April in the Senate voted against a package with $61 billion in aid for Ukraine. 'I have been to \u2013 I've actually, I've actually watched and seen the stories, and I know what happens is you bring people. You bring them on a propaganda tour, Mr. President,' Vance shot back. Then Trump jumped in to defend his vice president. 'You've allowed to be in a very bad position, and it happens to be right about that. YOu're not in a good position. You don't have the cards right now.' Vance blamed previous Democratic U.S. administrations for failing to stop Russia, but Zelensky tried to shift the conversation back to Putin. 'He killed people,' he said. President Donald Trump and Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky\u00a0were seen sitting side by side in front of the fireplace in the Oval Office President Donald Trump and Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky's meeting in the Oval Office involved\u00a050 minutes of arguing, finger-wagging and fury The tension was palpable as Mr Zelensky, speaking in broken English and at times appearing very nervous, explained his country's desperate situation 'What kind of diplomacy, JD, are you speaking about,' the Ukrainian asked, referring to Vance by his first name rather than his formal title. 'I'm not playing cards,' Zelensky responded, speaking over him. 'Have you said thank you once?' Vance blasted Zelensky at one point in the conflagration. 'Just say thank you,' Vance told him. 'I said it a lot of times,' Zelensky responded. Zelensky's first words had been: 'Thank you so much, Mr. President, thank you for the invitation' \u2013 although Vance appeared to be seeking gratitude for the massive infusion of military aid.

While the Ukrainians were waiting in the other room, national security adviser Mike Waltz and Secretary of State Marco Rubio told them to leave. The official said Zelenskyy was trying to smooth things over and asked for a reset, but Mr. Trump and other administration officials were offended by Zelenskyy's behavior.\u00a0 The contentious meeting exposed severe rifts between the U.S. and Ukraine, upending the planned signing of a rare minerals deal between the two countries as Mr. Trump pressures Ukraine to agree to end the war that Russia began. During the course of the meeting, Mr. Trump threatened Zelenskyy to make a deal with Russia or \"we're out,\" and Vance accused the Ukrainian leader of being \"disrespectful.\" Later in the day, high level administration sources confirmed to CBS that there have been discussions about whether U.S. will keep sending military aid to Ukraine after the Oval Office clash between Mr. Trump and Zelenskyy. \"They are fortunate it is not off already,\" a senior U.S. official said to CBS News on the status of U.S. aid to Ukraine.\nThe meeting veered into tense exchanges after Vance said during the course of the meeting that the world has reached this point in part because of the Biden administration's actions, and said it was time for diplomacy.\u00a0 Zelenskyy challenged Vance on this point, noting there had been other ceasefire agreements Russian President Vladimir Putin had broken \u2014 and not just during the Obama administration. During Mr. Trump's administration\u00a0 Putin violated \u00a0the Minsk ceasefire agreements, which\u00a0 had been signed \u00a0by both Russia and Ukraine. And Zelenskyy pointed out that he had signed an agreement with Putin over the exchange of prisoners, \"but he didn't do it.\" \"What kind of diplomacy, JD, you are speaking about,\" Zelenskyy asked Vance. Vance retorted that it was \"disrespectful\" for Zelenskyy to try to \"litigate\" his case in front of the American media.\n\"You should be thanking the president for trying to bring an end to this conflict,\" Vance told Zelenskyy.\nHeated Trump-Zelenskyy meeting in Oval Office | Special Report\n21:01\nZelenskyy asked Vance if he'd ever been to Ukraine.\u00a0 Vance said he's watched videos of what's happened in Ukraine, accusing Zelenskyy of bringing people on a \"propaganda tour\" when they visit Ukraine.\u00a0 \"Do you think that it's respectful to come to the Oval Office of the United States of America and attack the administration that is trying to prevent the destruction of your country?\" Vance asked.\u00a0 Zelenskyy, noting that for now, the U.S. is separated from the fighting by an ocean, said of the war, \"You don't feel it now, but you'll feel it in the future.\"\u00a0 \"You don't know that,\" Mr. Trump argued. \"You don't know that. Don't tell us what we're going to feel. We're trying to solve a problem. Don't tell us what we're gonna feel, because you're in no position to dictate that. You're in no position to dictate what we're going to feel. We're going to feel very good.\"\u00a0 \"You don't have the cards right now,\" Mr. Trump said, as Zelenskyy continued to interject and disagree. \"With us, you start having cards. Right now, you don't have your playing cards, your playing cards \u2014 you're gambling with the lives of millions of people. \"You're gambling with World War III. You're gambling with World War III.\"\n\"Have you said 'thank you' once, this entire meeting? No, in this entire meeting, have you said 'thank you,'\" Vance said.\u00a0 Zelenskyy kept a measured tone throughout the entire exchange, even as Mr. Trump and Vance at times raised their voices.\u00a0 \"Please,\" Zelenskyy said. \"You think that if you will speak very loudly about the war\u2014\" Mr. Trump cut off Zelenskyy and said his country is in \"big trouble\" but \"you have a damn good chance of coming out okay because of us.\"\u00a0 Zelenskyy said his country has stayed strong from the beginning of the war, and Ukrainians are thankful.\u00a0 \"It's going to be a very hard thing to do business like this,\" Mr. Trump said, as Vance again chided Zelenskyy about saying \"thank you.\" Mr. Trump said it's \"good\" for the American people to see what's going on.\n\"You have to be thankful,\" Mr. Trump said. \"You don't have the cards. You're buried there, people are dying, you're running low on soldiers.\" Zelenskyy said Ukraine wants the war to end but must have security assurances along with any sort of ceasefire agreement.\u00a0 Amid the chaos, a reporter asked \u2014 what if Russia violates a ceasefire? \"What if anything?\" Mr. Trump responded. \"What if a bomb drops on your head right now? Okay?\"\u00a0 Earlier in their meeting, before it grew heated, Zelenskyy said negotiations can't only entail talk of a ceasefire, as Mr. Trump pushes for a ceasefire agreement without security assurances included.\u00a0 \"Just ceasefire will never work,\" Zelenskyy said, adding that \"25 times\" Putin \"broke his own signature,\" or violated his word on agreements.\u00a0 \"But he never broke to me,\" Mr. Trump said.\nA White House official said that the Ukrainians \"have been difficult to negotiate with [for] quite some time,\" and the Oval Office argument was \"the tipping point.\" The minerals deal would have been a \"first step to a lasting peace,\" but Zelenskyy \"overplayed his cards.\" The meeting went so poorly that after it ended, Mr. Trump continued to criticize Zelenskyy on social media, saying he is \"not ready for peace.\"\u00a0 \"We had a very meaningful meeting in the White House today,\" Mr. Trump wrote on Truth Social. \"Much was learned that could never be understood without conversation under such fire and pressure. It's amazing what comes out through emotion, and I have determined that President Zelenskyy is not ready for Peace if America is involved, because he feels our involvement gives him a big advantage in negotiations. I don't want advantage, I want PEACE. He disrespected the United States of America in its cherished Oval Office. He can come back when he is ready for Peace.\" \u00a0 Zelenskyy was spotted leaving the White House at 1:41 p.m. After his team was told to leave the White House, Zelenskyy posted on X : \"Thank you America, thank you for your support, thank you for this visit. Thank you\u00a0 @POTUS , Congress, and the American people. Ukraine needs just and lasting peace, and we are working exactly for that.\" Zelenskyy was scheduled to speak at the Hudson Institute in Washington Friday afternoon, but according to event organizers, Zelenskyy's office informed them he would not be coming.\u00a0 As Mr. Trump left for his Mar-a-Lago property in Florida on Friday afternoon, CBS News asked him what Zelensky needs to do in order for Mr. Trump to restart talks.\n\"He's gotta say, 'I wanna make peace,'\" Mr. Trump said. \"He doesn't have to stand there and say about, 'Putin this, Putin that.' All negative things. He's gotta say, 'I wanna make peace. I don't want to fight a war any longer.' His people are dying. He doesn't have the cards just so you understand it, okay?\" Administration sources on next steps High-level sources with the Trump administration told CBS News that Ukrainian officials reached out Friday afternoon to senior White House officials desperate to get the deal back on track. However, they were told that would not happen today. Mr. Trump was unwilling to talk to Zelenskyy further today, the sources said.\u00a0 When Rubio and Waltz went into the Roosevelt Room of the White House to ask Zelenskyy to leave, they made it clear that any further engagements Friday would be counterproductive, the sources said, adding that Waltz told Zelenskyy that he had made a tremendous mistake and a disservice to Ukraine and to the U.S. No phone calls between Mr. Trump and Putin have been scheduled, the sources added, while multiple European officials have called top Trump officials since Zelenskyy departed the White House asking how the minerals deal can be salvaged.\u00a0 Zelenskyy will meet British Prime Minister Keir Starmer on Saturday, Starmer's office said, ahead of a wider summit of European leaders in London on Sunday to discuss a peace plan for Ukraine, Reuters news agency reported. Regarding Zelenskyy's request for military guarantees, the U.S. made it clear Mr. Trump wanted an economic partnership, and then they would talk about the guarantees as part of the ceasefire if it happened, the sources said. There was no discussion among Trump officials about putting U.S. boots on the ground. The sources said that the White House is uncertain if it can help facilitate an end to the fighting. Mr. Trump is not seeking regime change in Ukraine, the sources said, and there have been no discussions about who in Ukraine might be a better leader than Zelenskyy.\nWhat to know about Zelenskyy's White House visit Mr. Trump mentioned earlier this week that the U.S. had reached a deal with Zelenskyy on a broad framework for sharing Ukraine's\u00a0 mineral resources , and that the Ukrainian leader was coming to the White House because he \"would like to sign it together with me.\" Negotiations over the minerals continued despite public tension between the two leaders in recent days. Mr. Trump appeared to blame Ukraine for the war Russia started and labeled Zelenskyy a \"dictator,\" while declining to say the same of Russian President Vladimir Putin.\u00a0 One Ukrainian official told CBS News Kyiv hopes the signing of the agreement would ensure the continued flow of security support that Ukraine needs. Mr. Trump said Thursday the deal would help pay back American taxpayers for supporting Ukraine over the past three years.\nPresident Trump greets Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy as he arrives at the White House on Feb. 28, 2025.\nGetty Images\nIn a post on X Wednesday, Zelenskyy wrote , \"Peace and security guarantees are the key to ensuring that Russia can no longer destroy the lives of other nations.\" He added, \"For me and for all of us in the world, it's important that U.S. support is not stopped. Strength is needed on the path to peace.\" Mr. Trump spoke with Putin earlier this month and said the Russian leader wants an end to the war. Last week, the president said he trusts Russia to negotiate in good faith, as top Trump administration officials met with Russian negotiators in Saudi Arabia without a Ukrainian representative. The president on Thursday said he believes Putin would comply with any peace agreement reached.\u00a0 \"I don't believe he's going to violate his word,\" Mr. Trump said.\u00a0 Mr. Trump last week called Zelenskyy a \"dictator,\" \u00a0referring to the fact that the Ukrainian leader's five-year term expired last year, and no new election has been held. Ukraine has been under martial law since soon after the war started in 2022, and the country's constitution bans elections during martial law. On Monday, during a meeting with French President Emmanuel Macron, Mr. Trump was asked whether he views Putin as a dictator, since he called Zelenskyy one.\u00a0 \"I don't use those words lightly, I think that we're going to see how it all works out,\" he replied. \"Let's see what happens.\"\nMr. Trump has even cast blame on Kyiv for being invaded by Russia. \"You should have never started it, you could have made a deal,\" Mr. Trump said of Ukraine last week.\u00a0 Top Trump administration officials have also been reluctant to criticize Putin. National security adviser Mike Waltz didn't answer directly when a reporter asked him if Mr. Trump views Putin as a dictator. He also sidestepped a question about who bears more responsibility for the war, Russia or Ukraine. Referring to Mr. Trump, Waltz replied, \"His goal here is to bring this war to an end, period.\" The president frequently says the war never would have started if he had been president, rather than Joe Biden. On the campaign trail, Mr. Trump vowed he would end the war between Russia and Ukraine before even taking office.\u00a0 \"Before I even arrive at the Oval Office, shortly after we win the presidency, I will have the horrible war between Russia and Ukraine settled,\" Mr. Trump said at a June rally. \"I will get it settled before I even become president.\" But after winning the election, Mr. Trump suggested that reaching peace between Russia and Ukraine might be more difficult than forging peace in the Middle East.\n\"I think actually more difficult is going to be the Russia-Ukraine situation,\" Mr. Trump said in December. \"I see that as more difficult.\" Earlier this week, Zelenskyy said he would give up the presidency if doing so would achieve lasting peace for Ukraine and membership in NATO.\u00a0 \"If to achieve peace, you really need me to give up my post, I'm ready,\" Zelenskyy said at a forum marking the three-year anniversary of Russia's full-scale invasion.\nWar in Ukraine\nMore\nMost European leaders back Zelenskyy as he joins crisis talks in London\nEuropean allies rally around Ukraine after Trump-Zelenskyy rift\nWatch video of Trump and Zelenskyy's meeting\nZelenskyy was told to leave the White House after blowup with Trump and Vance\nU.K. ready to put \"boots on the ground\" to support peace deal in Ukraine, Starmer says\nMore\nIn:\n JD Vance\nRare Earth Minerals\nUkraine\nDonald Trump\nRussia\nWhite House\nVolodymyr Zelenskyy\nKathryn Watson\nKathryn Watson is a politics reporter for CBS News Digital, based in Washington, D.C.\n\u00a9 2025 CBS Interactive Inc.

This time, it placed him at center of tense Oval Office exchange\nBy Kit Maher and Kevin Liptak , CNN\n5 minute read\nPublished\n 6:00 AM EST, Sun March 2, 2025\nLink Copied!\nFollow:\nJD Vance\nSee your latest updates\nVice President JD Vance speaks during a meeting with President Donald Trump, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and Secretary of State Marco Rubio in the Oval Office on February 28, 2025.\nAndrew Harnik/Getty Images\nCNN\n\u2014\nCampaigning in Pennsylvania last September, JD Vance seemed to strike at an unlikely political foe: the besieged president of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelensky, who\u2019d spent most of the previous two years being hailed by Western leaders as a hero.\n\u201cYou know what I wish Zelensky would do when he comes to the United States of America?\u201d Vance asked his rally audience. \u201cSay thank you to the people of Pennsylvania and everybody else.\u201d\nThe crowd in Pennsylvania responded with hearty cheers. The future vice president had struck a nerve.\nFive months later, the moment seems prescient. A perceived lack of gratitude on the part of Zelensky is precisely what Vance seized on Friday, this time in the Oval Office, setting off an explosive rupture in ties between Washington and Kyiv and charting an unknown course for the future of the conflict.\nIn reality, Zelensky has repeatedly thanked the United States and its leaders for supporting Ukraine.\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in the Oval Office during a meeting with US President Donald Trump on Friday.\nBrian Snyder/Reuters\nRelated article\nZelensky says Trump\u2019s backing is \u2018crucial\u2019 after US president berated him at White House\nYet for Vance, sitting on the gold brocade couch across from Zelensky, the moment thrust him to the forefront of an administration in which he had so far been relegated to supporting player. It amounted to a sudden real-life manifestation of Vance\u2019s combative online persona, one that was quickly embraced by President Donald Trump \u2019s team.\nAt the same time, Vance\u2019s interjection into the meeting nearly 40 minutes after it began generated questions about just how impromptu his rebuke really was.\n\u201cIt smacks of an ambush, that JD Vance knew what he was doing,\u201d Democratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal, who met earlier Friday with Zelensky, said after the explosive Oval Office meeting. \u201cHe probably anticipated Trump would rise to the bait, so to speak, and that Zelensky was basically laying out the betrayal and the dishonesty of Putin,\u201d the Connecticut senator said, referring to Russian President Vladimir Putin.\nWhite House officials insist there was no ambush planned on Zelensky inside the Oval Office, pointing to the signing of an agreement on rare-earth minerals \u2014 complete with a long wooden table for the signatories \u2014 aides had planned for later in the day.\nInstead, they say Trump and Vance both felt disrespected by their Ukrainian guest, who pressed for American security guarantees even as the visit was meant to be centered on the rare-earths pact.\nAn administration source told CNN that \u201cnobody expected the meeting to play out as it did\u201d and expressed surprise at Zelensky\u2019s approach.\nVance\u2019s role in the argument followed him Saturday to Vermont, where protesters \u2014 some waving Ukrainian flags \u2014 lined the sidewalk awaiting his motorcade\u2019s arrival at Sugarbush Resort for a family trip. One person waved a \u201cGO SKI IN RUSSIA TRAITOR\u201d sign, while another poster read, \u201cSHAME ON YOU VANCE.\u201d\nTrump and his aides, however, enthusiastically heralded the vice president\u2019s combatting performance.\nFriday night, the White House Instagram account posted a photo prominently featuring Vance firmly pointing his hand toward Zelensky.\nU.S. President Donald Trump meets with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy at the White House in Washington, D.C., U.S., February 28, 2025. REUTERS/Brian Snyder\nBrian Snyder/Reuters\nanalysis\nZelensky invades Trump\u2019s \u2018disinformation space\u2019 \u2014 and it could really hurt Ukraine\n\u201cDo you think that is respectful to come to the Oval Office of the United States of America and attack the administration that is trying to prevent the destruction of your country?\u201d the post read, quoting Vance.\nHighlighted in red: \u201cHave you said thank you once?\u201d\nWhile Vance has been in the Oval Office for other foreign leaders\u2019 visits, including with French President Emmanuel Macron earlier last week, he remained largely an observer, sitting back on the yellow couch with his hands folded in his lap.\nIn Trump\u2019s first Cabinet meeting , it was billionaire Elon Musk \u2014 who has generated far more attention than Vance as he slashes through the federal bureaucracy \u2014 whom Trump allowed to speak for about six minutes.\nVance, by contrast, spoke for just 36 seconds, when Trump punted a question to him about what concessions he\u2019d like to see from Putin.\n\u201cGreat, you gave me the hardest question, sir,\u201d Vance said during the Wednesday meeting. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to do the negotiation in public in front of the American media. He\u2019s going to do it in private with the president of Russia, with the president of Ukraine and with other leaders.\u201d\nTurning next to address the media, Vance used the rest of his brief moment to criticize the press and flatter his boss.\n\u201cEvery single time the president engages in diplomacy, you guys preemptively accuse him of conceding to Russia. He hasn\u2019t conceded anything to anyone. He\u2019s doing the job of a diplomat, and he of course is the \u2018diplomat in chief\u2019 as the president of the United States,\u201d he said, before the meeting moved on.\nBefore Friday, Vance\u2019s most prominent event since taking office occurred 4,000 miles from the White House.\nIn a speech that shocked the Munich Security Conference last month, Vance lambasted European politicians, claiming they are suppressing free speech, losing control of immigration and refusing to work with hard-right parties in government. Later, he met with the leader of the far-right Alternative for Germany party, which has been courting the Trump administration . A Vance official said over the course of his trip overseas, the vice president met with the leaders of each major German political party.\nVance\u2019s speech in Germany, his defense of Trump\u2019s diplomatic efforts during the Cabinet meeting and his accusations of ingratitude on the campaign trail all merged into Friday\u2019s Oval Office debacle.\nAfter a tense back-and-forth with Zelensky, Vance ultimately struck on the same argument he made as a candidate.\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy holds an American flag that was gifted to him by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi of Calif., after he addressed a joint meeting of Congress on Capitol Hill in Washington, Wednesday, Dec. 21, 2022.

Scott Applewhite/AP\nRelated article\nFact check: 33 times Zelensky thanked Americans and US leaders\n\u201cOffer some words of appreciation for the United States of America,\u201d Vance said, gesturing his hand toward Trump, \u201cand the president of the United States of America, who is trying to save your country.\u201d\nThe extraordinary moment displayed a new side of Trump and Vance\u2019s relationship, as the pair appeared to team up against Zelensky in real time.\n\u201cPlease, you think that if you speak very loudly about the war \u2014\u201d Zelensky said.\nJumping to Vance\u2019s defense, Trump said, \u201cHe\u2019s not speaking loudly.\u201d\nThere was a moment, though, that Trump took a different view from Vance, after the vice president scolded Zelensky for litigating disagreements in front of the press.\n\u201cJust say thank you \u2014\u201d Vance said.\n\u201cI said it a lot of times to the American people,\u201d Zelensky said.\n\u201cAccept that there are disagreements and let\u2019s go litigate those rather than trying to fight it out in front of the American media when you\u2019re wrong,\u201d Vance said.\nTrump piped up, \u201cBut you see, I think it\u2019s good for the American people to see what\u2019s going on. I think it\u2019s very important. That\u2019s why I kept this going so long.\u201d\nAfter wrapping the bilateral meeting, Trump said it would make \u201cgreat television.\u201d\nAs reporters were eventually escorted out of the room, Vance gave Trump two approving pats on his arm.\nAd Feedback\nAd Feedback\nAd Feedback\nAd Feedback\nAd Feedback\nSubscribe\nSign in\nMy Account\nSettings\nNewsletters\nTopics You Follow\nSign Out\nYour CNN account\nSign in to your CNN account\nLive TV\nListen\nWatch\nUS\nCrime + Justice\nWorld\nAfrica\nAmericas\nAsia\nAustralia\nChina\nEurope\nIndia\nMiddle East\nUnited Kingdom\nPolitics\nSCOTUS\nCongress\nFacts First\n2024 Elections\nBusiness\nTech\nMedia\nCalculators\nVideos\nMarkets\nPre-markets\nAfter-Hours\nFear & Greed\nInvesting\nMarkets Now\nNightcap\nHealth\nLife, But Better\nFitness\nFood\nSleep\nMindfulness\nRelationships\nEntertainment\nMovies\nTelevision\nCelebrity\nTech\nInnovate\nForeseeable Future\nMission: Ahead\nWork Transformed\nInnovative Cities\nStyle\nArts\nDesign\nFashion\nArchitecture\nLuxury\nBeauty\nVideo\nTravel\nDestinations\nFood & Drink\nStay\nNews\nVideos\nSports\nPro Football\nCollege Football\nBasketball\nBaseball\nSoccer\nOlympics\nHockey\nScience\nSpace\nLife\nUnearthed\nClimate\nSolutions\nWeather\nWeather\nVideo\nClimate\nUkraine-Russia War\nIsrael-Hamas War\nWatch\nLive TV\nCNN Headlines\nCNN Shorts\nShows A-Z\nCNN10\nCNN Max\nCNN TV Schedules\nFlashDocs\nListen\nCNN 5 Things\nChasing Life with Dr. Sanjay Gupta\nThe Assignment with Audie Cornish\nOne Thing\nTug of War\nCNN Political Briefing\nThe Axe Files\nAll There Is with Anderson Cooper\nAll CNN Audio podcasts\nCNN Underscored\nElectronics\nFashion\nBeauty\nHealth & Fitness\nHome\nReviews\nDeals\nGifts\nTravel\nOutdoors\nPets\nGames\nCNN Crossword\nJumble Crossword\nPhoto Shuffle\nSudoblock\nSudoku\n5 Things Quiz\nAbout CNN\nSubscribe\nPhotos\nInvestigations\nCNN Profiles\nCNN Leadership\nCNN Newsletters\nWork for CNN\nPolitics\nWatch\nListen\nLive TV\nFollow CNN Politics\nSubscribe\nSign in\nMy Account\nSettings\nNewsletters\nTopics You Follow\nSign Out\nYour CNN account\nSign in to your CNN account\nTerms of Use\nPrivacy Policy\nAd Choices\nAccessibility & CC\nAbout\nSubscribe\nNewsletters\nTranscripts\nHelp Center\n\u00a9 2025 Cable News Network.

Zelensky has eschewed suits, button-down shirts and ties - even during important meetings with world leaders and an address to the US Congress - since the start of the full-scale Russian invasion of his country began in 2022. The Ukrainian leader has said his choice of clothing is a show of solidarity with soldiers fighting the Russian army on the war's frontlines. ADVERTISEMENT But it has long been an irritant for some critics of US aid to Ukraine, and after years as a talking point in right-wing media circles, the issue came to global attention in a spectacular way during Friday's now infamous Oval Office meeting with Trump and US Vice-President JD Vance. A question to Zelensky from a reporter accused him of disrespecting the occasion by not wearing a suit and this immediately changed the atmosphere in the room, according to BBC reporters present. And a short time later, larger issues of respect and gratitude fuelled the extraordinary argument that saw the US president and vice-president upbraid their European ally in front of the world's TV cameras. European leaders back Zelensky after Trump clash How the Trump-Zelensky talks collapsed in 10 fiery minutes Zelensky wants US to 'stand more firmly' on Ukraine's side When the meeting was opened up to questions from reporters, one came from Brian Glenn, chief White House correspondent for conservative cable network Real America's Voice. ADVERTISEMENT \"Why don't you wear a suit?\" Glenn asked. \"You're at the highest level in this country's office, and you refuse to wear a suit. \"Do you own a suit?\" he continued. \"A lot of Americans have problems with you not respecting the dignity of this office.\" The aggressive questioning marked the moment when the Ukrainian president \u2013 who until then seemed to be having a diplomatic, even friendly, conversation with Trump \u2013 first appeared tired and irritated. \"I will wear costume after this war will finish,\" Zelensky replied. (The word \"suit\" can be translated into Ukrainian as \"kostyum\".) The Ukrainian president then made a verbal jab at the reporter. \"Maybe something like yours, yes. Maybe something better, I don't know,\" he said, to laughter in the room. \"Maybe something cheaper.\" ADVERTISEMENT 'Trump and Vance were so rude': Ukrainians react to disastrous White House meeting Most Republicans laud Trump after Zelensky showdown, but some express dismay Glenn's question gave voice to a longstanding gripe in the world of Make America Great Again (Maga) politics, where some - like JD Vance - argue that the Ukrainian leader does not seem to be showing enough gratitude or respect to the US for three years of military aid. A former local TV reporter in Dallas who became better known in conservative circles for his work at another pro-Trump channel, Right Side Broadcasting Network, Glenn is an unabashed Trump fan. Last year he told Politico that he was \"100 percent behind President Trump and the America First agenda.\" He is also reportedly dating Marjorie Taylor Greene, the Georgia congresswoman who is one of Trump's most outspoken supporters. Glenn was in the room as part of the White House press pool, a group of reporters which covers the president at official events on behalf of the wider media. ADVERTISEMENT The Trump administration took control of the pool this week from an association of journalists, saying it would give more access to \"new voices\". It has continued to bar the Associated Press from the pool. Glenn and Greene pictured in Washington last year [Getty Images] Real America's Voice, which was founded in 2020, is a relatively obscure right-wing cable news outlet, one of several pro-Trump channels that have cropped up in recent years. Its guests and hosts have spread conspiracy theories about a variety of subjects, including the 2020 presidential election, the 2021 Capitol riot and QAnon. Its show line-up includes some big names from the Maga world, including Trump's former chief advisor Steve Bannon, classic rocker turned political activist Ted Nugent and Charlie Kirk, the founder of the conservative Turning Point group. The BBC contacted the network for comment. After the Oval Office spat, Glenn posted online that he had \"extreme empathy for the people of Ukraine\" but said that Zelensky's lack of a suit demonstrated \"his inner disrespect\" for the US. Zelensky's defenders online posted pictures of Winston Churchill wearing casual clothes during World War Two. Pictures from the period show the British leader wearing jumpsuit-like clothes to a meeting with then-US President Franklin Roosevelt, and he also wore military uniforms and suits during conflabs with world leaders. Churchill wore a one-piece suit - which he called a 'siren suit' after the warning horns which signalled a German air raid - to the White House in the midst of the Second World War [Central Press/Hulton Archive/Getty Images] After Glenn's question, the news conference swiftly moved on, to a query about whether the US would send more arms to Ukraine. At the end of an answer Trump referred back to the suit question. \"I do like your clothing,\" he quipped, and pointing to Zelensky he said, \"I think he's dressed beautifully.\" Behind the scenes, Trump's attitude may have been slightly different, according to reports. US news outlet Axios reported that before the meeting, White House staffers had requested that Zelensky wear a suit and were offended when he did not. However, the two world leaders continued taking questions, more or less cordially, for nearly another 20 minutes before the extraordinary argument broke out, after an interruption by the US vice-president, JD Vance. Vance repeatedly brought up \"respect\" \u2013 referring to Zelensky as \"Mr President\" as the Ukrainian leader called him \"JD\" \u2013 and said: \"I think it's disrespectful for you to come into the Oval Office and try to litigate this in front of the American media right now\". The discussion went downhill from there. A suit-less Zelensky was soon ejected from the White House, as relations between the two countries reached a new wartime low.

Share full article Brian Glenn at a House subcommittee hearing in Washington in February. Credit... Al Drago/Getty Images By Zach Montague Reporting from West Palm Beach, Fla. Published March 1, 2025 Updated March 2, 2025, 6:00 a.m. ET A voice from the press section joined the chorus of people demanding answers from President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine on Friday, during a meeting with President Trump and his associates. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you wear a suit?\u201d a man asked Mr. Zelensky. \u201cYou\u2019re at the highest level in this country\u2019s office, and you refuse to wear a suit. Just want to see if \u2014 do you own a suit?\u201d He added, \u201cA lot of Americans have problems with you not respecting the office.\u201d The questions came from Brian Glenn, a correspondent for Real America\u2019s Voice, a right-wing cable channel that has spread conspiracy theories about noncitizen voting and helped distribute Stephen K. Bannon\u2019s \u201cWar Room\u201d podcast after Mr. Bannon was barred from YouTube, Spotify and other mainstream platforms. Mr. Glenn\u2019s outlet was selected to take a \u201csecondary TV\u201d role in the White House press pool alongside CNN on Friday \u2014 a position that did not exist before this week. That access was granted as the White House continued to block reporters from The Associated Press from attending, according to a schedule sent out by the White House, and as it began this week to handpick the pool reporters who cover the president in small settings, such as the Oval Office meeting with Mr. Zelensky. Pool reporters attend the events in a rotation traditionally organized by the White House Correspondents\u2019 Association and share their observations with other outlets not present. Mr. Glenn\u2019s comments about Mr. Zelensky\u2019s appearance echoed Mr. Trump\u2019s on Friday as the Ukrainian leader stepped out of his car at the White House. \u201cHe\u2019s all dressed up today,\u201d Mr. Trump told reporters , indicating Mr. Zelensky\u2019s attire. Since the start of the war, Mr. Zelensky has regularly donned standard-issue field uniforms as a display of solidarity with his country\u2019s armed forces. The criticism that he didn\u2019t wear a suit drew immediate outcry online. Mr. Zelensky received an outpouring of support internationally after the meeting, which had become adversarial long before Mr. Glenn\u2019s questions. Lawmakers and media critics were quick to point out that just this week, Elon Musk had appeared at a cabinet meeting wearing a T-shirt emblazoned with the words \u201ctech support\u201d under an overcoat. And when Mr. Musk spoke alongside Mr. Trump in the Oval Office earlier this month, he appeared to be wearing a shirt that read \u201cOccupy Mars.\u201d Responding to the backlash, Mr. Glenn posted a lengthy personal statement on Saturday morning expressing \u201cextreme empathy for the people of Ukraine\u201d but continuing to berate Mr. Zelensky. He suggested in the post that the olive-green military fatigues that Mr. Zelensky often wears in meetings with other world leaders signaled respect, but that the black tactical sweater bearing his country\u2019s coat of arms did not. \u201cFor him, once again, to enter the highest office in the most powerful nation in the world, dressed as he did, reflects his inner disrespect for not only our country, the President and the US citizens that have made it possible for Ukraine to survive as long as they have to this point,\u201d Mr. Glenn wrote. On Friday, Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, who is dating Mr. Glenn, applauded the exchange on social media. \u201cI\u2019m so proud of @brianglenntv for pointing out that Zelensky has so much disrespect for America that he can\u2019t even wear a suit in the Oval Office when he comes to beg for money from our President,\u201d she wrote.

Zelensky has eschewed suits, button-down shirts and ties - even during important meetings with world leaders and an address to the US Congress - since the start of the full-scale Russian invasion of his country began in 2022. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement The Ukrainian leader has said his choice of clothing is a show of solidarity with soldiers fighting the Russian army on the war's frontlines. But it has long been an irritant for some critics of US aid to Ukraine, and after years as a talking point in right-wing media circles, the issue came to global attention in a spectacular way during Friday's now infamous Oval Office meeting with Trump and US Vice-President JD Vance. A question to Zelensky from a reporter accused him of disrespecting the occasion by not wearing a suit and this immediately changed the atmosphere in the room, according to BBC reporters present. And a short time later, larger issues of respect and gratitude fuelled the extraordinary argument that saw the US president and vice-president upbraid their European ally in front of the world's TV cameras. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement European leaders back Zelensky after Trump clash How the Trump-Zelensky talks collapsed in 10 fiery minutes Zelensky wants US to 'stand more firmly' on Ukraine's side When the meeting was opened up to questions from reporters, one came from Brian Glenn, chief White House correspondent for conservative cable network Real America's Voice. \"Why don't you wear a suit?\" Glenn asked. \"You're at the highest level in this country's office, and you refuse to wear a suit. \"Do you own a suit?\" he continued. \"A lot of Americans have problems with you not respecting the dignity of this office.\" The aggressive questioning marked the moment when the Ukrainian president \u2013 who until then seemed to be having a diplomatic, even friendly, conversation with Trump \u2013 first appeared tired and irritated. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement \"I will wear costume after this war will finish,\" Zelensky replied. (The word \"suit\" can be translated into Ukrainian as \"kostyum\".) The Ukrainian president then made a verbal jab at the reporter. \"Maybe something like yours, yes. Maybe something better, I don't know,\" he said, to laughter in the room. \"Maybe something cheaper.\" 'Trump and Vance were so rude': Ukrainians react to disastrous White House meeting Most Republicans laud Trump after Zelensky showdown, but some express dismay Glenn's question gave voice to a longstanding gripe in the world of Make America Great Again (Maga) politics, where some - like JD Vance - argue that the Ukrainian leader does not seem to be showing enough gratitude or respect to the US for three years of military aid. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement A former local TV reporter in Dallas who became better known in conservative circles for his work at another pro-Trump channel, Right Side Broadcasting Network, Glenn is an unabashed Trump fan. Last year he told Politico that he was \"100 percent behind President Trump and the America First agenda.\" He is also reportedly dating Marjorie Taylor Greene, the Georgia congresswoman who is one of Trump's most outspoken supporters. Glenn was in the room as part of the White House press pool, a group of reporters which covers the president at official events on behalf of the wider media. The Trump administration took control of the pool this week from an association of journalists, saying it would give more access to \"new voices\". It has continued to bar the Associated Press from the pool. Glenn and Greene pictured in Washington last year [Getty Images] Real America's Voice, which was founded in 2020, is a relatively obscure right-wing cable news outlet, one of several pro-Trump channels that have cropped up in recent years. Its guests and hosts have spread conspiracy theories about a variety of subjects, including the 2020 presidential election, the 2021 Capitol riot and QAnon. Advertisement Advertisement Its show line-up includes some big names from the Maga world, including Trump's former chief advisor Steve Bannon, classic rocker turned political activist Ted Nugent and Charlie Kirk, the founder of the conservative Turning Point group. The BBC contacted the network for comment. After the Oval Office spat, Glenn posted online that he had \"extreme empathy for the people of Ukraine\" but said that Zelensky's lack of a suit demonstrated \"his inner disrespect\" for the US. Zelensky's defenders online posted pictures of Winston Churchill wearing casual clothes during World War Two. Pictures from the period show the British leader wearing jumpsuit-like clothes to a meeting with then-US President Franklin Roosevelt, and he also wore military uniforms and suits during conflabs with world leaders. Churchill wore a one-piece suit - which he called a 'siren suit' after the warning horns which signalled a German air raid - to the White House in the midst of the Second World War [Central Press/Hulton Archive/Getty Images] After Glenn's question, the news conference swiftly moved on, to a query about whether the US would send more arms to Ukraine. At the end of an answer Trump referred back to the suit question. Advertisement Advertisement \"I do like your clothing,\" he quipped, and pointing to Zelensky he said, \"I think he's dressed beautifully.\" Behind the scenes, Trump's attitude may have been slightly different, according to reports. US news outlet Axios reported that before the meeting, White House staffers had requested that Zelensky wear a suit and were offended when he did not. However, the two world leaders continued taking questions, more or less cordially, for nearly another 20 minutes before the extraordinary argument broke out, after an interruption by the US vice-president, JD Vance. Vance repeatedly brought up \"respect\" \u2013 referring to Zelensky as \"Mr President\" as the Ukrainian leader called him \"JD\" \u2013 and said: \"I think it's disrespectful for you to come into the Oval Office and try to litigate this in front of the American media right now\". Advertisement Advertisement The discussion went downhill from there. A suit-less Zelensky was soon ejected from the White House, as relations between the two countries reached a new wartime low.
