Keith Kellogg, and White House chief of staff Susie Wiles were joined by Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina as the group rehashed what had just transpired. \n\nThey shared disbelief over what one source characterized as Zelenskyy badgering the president. Another official said that, had Zelenskyy kept his disagreements behind closed doors, the blowup wouldn't have happened.\n\nDuring the contentious meeting, Mr. Trump and Vance took an aggressive and sometimes belittling tone with Zelenskyy after he expressed doubt over whether Russian President Vladimir Putin would honor a potential peace agreement given that he had repeatedly violated ceasefire deals, including the Minsk agreements, leading up to Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine.\n\nIn the hours after Zelenskyy was asked to leave the White House at the behest of Rubio and Waltz \u2014 with a joint press conference scrapped \u2014 there was discussion about whether the Ukrainian leader should fire whoever may have advised him on Friday's strategy. CBS News has reached out to Ukrainian officials for comment. \n\nSome of the Trump team's frustration targeted Zelenskyy's chief adviser, Andriy Yermak, whom they believed had undermined negotiations in recent days. Others said they weren't so sure it was an adviser problem. \n\nIt wasn't the first time Zelenskyy had clashed with his American counterpart. President Biden once hung up on Zelenskyy because of the Ukrainian president's perceived combativeness, sources familiar with the call told CBS News. The friction was kept private and officials insist the dispute was over policy \u2014 not basic facts like which country had started the war. ",

How to Fact-Check\nBy the end of this chapter, you should have an idea of how to fact-check a standard work of journalism, including how to prepare for and conduct fact-checking interviews, how to work with documentary sources, and how to format your fact-checking documents and keep comprehensive records. In the sections from General Methodology to After the Fact-Check , we elaborate on steps 4 to 9 of the editorial process as described in the previous chapter. In Variations and Adapting to Constraints , we acknowledge that not every publication will be able to meet the ideal outlined here, and we discuss how to adapt these guidelines for different newsroom structures and resource constraints.\nThe practical advice given here is inspired by the thorough methodology practised by many magazines in the glory days of editorial fact-checking. It has also been informed by our experiences in the industry over the past decade, additional research into journalism practices and ethics, and conversations with more than fifty journalists, researchers, and community members (whose names are listed at the end of Chapter One .\nGeneral Methodology\nFact-checking can generally be broken down into three steps:\nVerification : Given a statement and the reporter's sources for that statement, the fact checker confirms that the statement is factual, identifies errors and suggests corrections, or determines that neither of these options is possible.\nInvestigation : The fact checker assesses the credibility of the sources used by the reporter and finds out what other credible sources say about the statement in question. Is there any nuance or context missing from the statement? Have any sourcing considerations been overlooked or misjudged?\nDocumentation : After the statement is confirmed or corrected, the fact checker preserves all sources, documents, and methodology for their (and their publication's) fact-checking records.\nThe reporter is responsible for ensuring the accuracy of every word that appears in their piece; the fact checker should be able to defend the accuracy of every word. This requires a documented source for every statement\u2014even the obvious or seemingly insignificant ones. Being \" checking sure \" that a fact is correct is a higher standard than being \"virtually certain.\" Doing the work to collect corroborating evidence, even if the fact is considered common knowledge, is a more reliable path to accuracy than relying on what we think we know.\nHere is a non-exhaustive list of details that should always be checked in a work of journalism:\nNames, dates, and locations\nQuotes and the facts within quotes\nDescriptions of people, places, and events\nPronouns, identifiers, and descriptors\nCausal explanations\nThe factual bases of opinions\nThe internal logic of a story, including its chronology\nWhile it's important to check every fact in a story, it's also important to prioritize where you spend your time. Some facts are easily verifiable and uncontroversial, so they can be checked quickly; others are relatively extraneous and, if they cannot be verified, can likely be cut from the story without affecting the narrative; others, however, deserve more time and investigative effort. Over time, with experience and the support of their editorial team, fact checkers learn to make these kinds of pragmatic decisions on their own.\nSome facts may not be verifiable\u2014either because the necessary sources do not exist or because they are inaccessible. (That rare book you're looking for may be impossible to access before your deadline, or the second party in an argument may vehemently refuse to speak with journalists.) In these cases, the fact checker tries to find other ways of corroborating the facts, with the help of the reporter. But in keeping with the value of transparency , the fact checker is also responsible for recognizing the limitations of verification in various contexts and communicating them to the editorial team.\nIt's important to convey the uncertainty surrounding a particular fact to the story's handling editor so that they can decide how best to adapt the story. They may choose to make the uncertainty itself part of the story: transparency about what journalists do and do not know is a way of giving audiences the power to make informed judgments on the information and narratives presented.\nFact checkers only suggest changes to a story; in most cases (unless the head of research becomes involved), the handling editor has final say on how a fact checker's corrections are implemented.\nBelow, we describe the standard methodology for fact-checking (separated into Preparation , Verification and Investigation , and Documentation ) and go through some Topic-Specific Advice .\nPreparation\nOnce the fact checker has been assigned a story, they read the latest draft to get a sense of what the assignment will require. Even if the story is still being edited and they haven't received the reporter's research package yet, it's a good idea to get started as early as possible: note how many people they think they will have to call, what kinds of gathered sources they expect to receive, and any foreseeable difficulties in verification. The fact checker also conducts background research that will help them become more familiar with the topic of the story and assess the appropriateness of the sourcing decisions made by the reporter\u2014for example, by reading literature reviews, encyclopedia entries, and news articles about the topic at hand. (As we note in Chapter Eight , this is especially important if the story is about a marginalized community with which the fact checker is not familiar.)\nOnce the fact checker has received the research package, they make a copy of the annotated draft and remove the footnotes. This will be the checking copy . The checking copy is the fact checker's master document, where they track their work as they go, and it's also the primary reference for anyone else who may later go through the fact-checking folder in order to determine the sourcing for a fact.\nEven though the fact checker builds their fact-checking folder digitally (see the Documentation section of this chapter), we recommend printing out a copy of the story when beginning a fact check. Doing so can help the fact checker organize their thoughts and plan out their approach to the check. We advise printing this copy double-spaced to leave room for comments, in pen or pencil, on the document.\nAs the fact checker reads through the draft (or printed copy), they keep the reporter's research package close at hand so that they can refer to their sources and comments. They pay special attention to the reporter's annotations: Are any sources missing? Do any interview subjects require special care? Is anything unclear? If so, the fact checker compiles their questions and concerns to send to the reporter, or they schedule a meeting with the reporter, handling editor, and head of research to discuss the best way forward.\nIf the fact checker has any questions about how to fact-check the story\u2014for example, because they think a source will ask for accommodations (see Chapter Seven ) or they are unsure how to assess a source (see Chapter Four )\u2014they discuss them with the head of research before getting started.\nIf there are illustrations, photographs, or infographics accompanying a work of journalism, they need to be fact-checked alongside everything else. The fact checker should receive these materials in the research package and include them in their checking copy and checked copy ; if they don't receive any, they should check in with the handling editor, since the reporter may not have been involved in creating graphics for their story.\nFact-checkers must be critical readers. If you don't clearly understand what a sentence means, you can't very well check its veracity. Also, the facts won't always present themselves to you on a plate\u2014you may need to extract them from statements in which fact and opinion are intertwined. Or you may need to infer the facts from passages in which they are not explicitly stated.\n\u2014Cynthia Brouse, After the Fact: A Guide to Fact-Checking for Magazines and Other Media (2007)\nVerification and Investigation\nFact checkers work with two kinds of sources: gathered sources (the records and documents they consult) and interviewed sources (the people they speak with). These require different approaches and methods of documentation, which we outline below.\nWhatever sources the fact checker is working with, their primary activity is to consider each isolated fact, consult the source the reporter has attributed it to, and confirm that everything lines up. But they sometimes have to do more investigation to clarify the fact, refute it, or attribute it to more reliable sources.\nShannon Palus, a veteran science fact checker and senior editor for Slate , says that a fact checker needs to know more than what is necessary for the confirmation or correction of the statement in question. For example, \"last Christmas\" in a 2022 story should become \"December 25, 2021\" in a fact-checking document. That level of detail may not be necessary for the story, but it's crucial for triangulating with other sources and ensuring that the timeline of the story is accurate.\nSimilarly, if the reporter uses a complex term or technical jargon in their story, the fact checker finds out what it means and includes that definition in their files. In doing so, they verify that the reporter has used the term appropriately, even if the term isn't defined in the story itself.\nAfter reading through the story in full (we recommend doing so more than once), the first thing the fact checker does is contact interviewed sources to schedule fact-checking calls. It's helpful to do this early, since not everyone will respond right way. The reporter should have made notes about any interview subjects' particularities\u2014frequent travellers who are difficult to contact, for example. The fact checker can use this information to plan ahead for their fact-checking calls.\nThe fact checker's initial message to a source (usually an email) should explain their intentions clearly, name the reporter, describe the topic of the story, and remind the source of when the original interview happened. It should identify the sender as a fact checker and explain that it's their job to make sure that the sources in the piece (and their ideas, work, and experiences) are presented accurately and fairly. It should then request a phone call within a reasonable time frame. (We usually request that sources respond within a week, but it depends on individual deadlines.) It's a good idea to leave time between the initial message and the first phone call to prepare questions and conduct research using gathered sources .\nIf the source does not answer, subsequent messages should include a firm deadline and communicate clearly that, if they do not speak with the fact checker in time, the checker may resort to using interview recordings or transcripts for confirmation (depending on what is available). Correspondence between the fact checker and the interviewed sources should be documented in the fact-checking folder.\nAs the fact checker is waiting for responses to their interview requests, they begin isolating the facts from the story however they prefer (we like to use coloured pens on the printed copy of the draft\u2014one colour for each interviewed source, another for all gathered sources). During this process, they make notes about the kinds of sourcing the reporter has attributed to each fact. These notes will be helpful for working through the fact check, especially if the story is particularly long or complex.\nWhile delineating the facts of the story, the fact checker should remain conscious of the big picture, make sure that the facts are presented without significant omissions, and confirm that the takeaway of the story is fair, plausible, and backed up by the available evidence. If there's a\u00a0narrative arc to the story, it can be helpful to draw out a timeline to ensure that everything is in logical order.\nFor any detail that seems shaky or controversial, the fact checker should be proactive in finding extra sources, even if they weren't originally consulted by the reporter for the story. However, if the fact checker is thinking of scheduling interviews with new sources, they should check with the reporter's research package first. (The reporter may have already reached out to that person and been denied an interview, or they may have a personal relationship that would make the source's participation inappropriate.)\nIf a fact seems impossible or very difficult to check, the fact checker consults with the head of research . If the fact checker finds that a fact is incorrect or unprovable and has an idea for an alternative, they can suggest it to the handling editor\u2014either during fact-check input or, if it will require a substantial rewrite, earlier on.\nNote: it's important for the fact checker to document their work as they go. That means you should read this entire chapter (including the Documentation instructions) before considering yourself ready for your first fact check.\nAuthoritative and Non-Authoritative Sources\nFact-checking involves sorting through, assessing, and documenting the reporter's gathered sources\u2014the published documents, online media, journal articles, and other records that they consulted during their reporting\u2014as well as having conversations with their interviewed sources.\nIt's important to think critically about the kinds of sources you have been given. The general rule of editorial fact-checking is that each fact should be confirmed with at least one primary source or two secondary sources. This is a helpful baseline, but it warrants some clarification.\nThe distinction between primary and secondary sources comes from historical research. For a historian, primary sources were produced during the time period being researched (such as diary entries, letters, and meeting notes) whereas secondary sources were produced later, by people who did not experience the time period first-hand (such as books or articles by other historians). Journalists have adapted this distinction to their own work: in The Chicago Guide to Fact-Checking , Brooke Borel describes primary sources as \"the closest you can get to the origin of a fact,\" while secondary sources \"may be a step or more removed from a primary source.\" Secondary sources interpret the facts via their own sources; primary sources give the facts.\nIn practice, it can be difficult to clearly and consistently classify sources in this way. Different publications and institutions classify primary and secondary sources differently, and the \"one primary source or two secondary sources\" rule is not always helpful for fact checkers. Some \"secondary\" sources, such as encyclopedia articles, can be reliable on their own, while some \"primary\" sources, such as government websites, can be full of errors. Instead of being guided by the primary/secondary source distinction, fact checkers should distinguish between authoritative and non-authoritative sources . We will discuss this idea at greater length in Chapter Four , but the important point is that authority is fact-relative: the kind of source that suffices to check a fact depends on the fact.\nFor example, someone's personal website is an authoritative source on how they spell their name and self-identify. But it is not an authoritative source on the ingredients used in the cream sauce at the restaurant they visited last week, even if they wrote a lengthy blog post about it. This is because the fact checker presumably doesn't know how the blog post was reported or according to what standard of accuracy it was produced. Instead, an authoritative source for that cream sauce recipe would be a picture of the recipe book the restaurant used, a phone call with the chef, or a fact-checked review of the restaurant published around the time of the blogger's visit.\nThe Independence Principle holds that each fact should be checked with at least one authoritative source or, if that is not possible, several independent non-authoritative sources. Fact checkers should avoid citing two news articles to confirm a fact: those articles may have been based on the same report, meaning they are not independent. It would be better to find the report itself and cite it directly.\nIf a fact can be verified only by non-authoritative sources, it may require in-text attribution to those sources\u2014for example, the addition of \"according to the Washington Post. \" The fact checker can suggest this kind of attribution as a correction in their checked copy.\nAuthoritative sources include:\nPeople on their own experiences and identities (including autobiographies)\nFirst-hand accounts, such as diary entries, photographs, video, audio, or witnesses of an event\nAn expert or spokesperson who represents community consensus on an issue\nKnowledge (of any form) that has already been fact-checked or has been produced using reliable methods and with integrity\nNon-authoritative sources include:\nNews articles on descriptions of people or events\nWitnesses describing other people's experiences\nPeople close to a person quoted or mentioned in a story\nKnowledge (of any form) that is not known to have been fact-checked or produced using reliable methods and with integrity\nThese lists can help the fact checker evaluate the sources cited in the reporter's research package. Whether a source should be considered authoritative depends on the fact and on the context of the story in which it is presented. For example, the same person can serve as an authoritative source on their own experience of an event while serving as a non-authoritative source on their sibling's experience of the same event.\nThere are many situations in which a non-authoritative source will nevertheless be the best source available. For example, a person close to someone mentioned in a story may be the most authoritative source possible if the person mentioned is not available to speak. But, because the friend of the source is a non-authoritative source, the Independence Principle dictates that the fact checker find additional corroborating sources and that the reporter be transparent with readers about the fact that they weren't able to speak with the most authoritative source on the matter.\nSources You Gather\nEvery gathered source used to confirm or refute a fact is saved in the fact-checking folder (as a PDF, media file, or otherwise) and assigned a number in its title. The fact checker marks the passages of the source that are directly relevant to the fact check so they can be easily found by others reviewing their work later on. If the source is a PDF, for example, the fact checker highlights the specific lines of text that confirm the fact (or the lines that refute it, if the source is in support of a correction the fact checker is suggesting). Media such as audio or video should include the relevant timestamps and, if possible, audio transcriptions.\nIn Chapter Four , we explain in greater detail how a fact checker may go about assessing the authority of a gathered source by asking how, why, where, when, and by whom it was created. Most of the time, the sources used by the reporter are adequate, and the fact checker needs only to confirm that the sources provided in the research package correspond to the facts of the story. If the fact is a direct quotation from a gathered source, make sure the punctuation and spelling has been preserved\u2014the quotation should match how it was written in the original source, even if it conflicts with your publication's house style.\nFor books that cannot be saved as PDFs, the fact checker scans or photographs pages that contain relevant information. Note that books\u2014just like newspapers, websites, and other such records\u2014are typically not fact-checked, so they do not count as authoritative sources on anything apart from their author's experiences, thoughts, and opinions. In The Fact Checker's Bible , Sarah Harrison Smith writes that \"some books may be even more dangerous to check from than newspapers\" because so few books have been produced with fact-checking in mind. If the reporter has used a book as a source for something other than a personal fact about the book's author, look at the references in the body of the text, the footnotes, or the bibliography to try to find out where the author got that information.\nSources You Speak With\nNearly every person quoted, cited by the reporter (even on background), named, or otherwise identifiable in a piece needs to be contacted during fact-checking. The fact checker may need to call additional people who weren't initially interviewed for the piece in order to verify hard-to-source facts. Together, these are the interviewed sources.\nNo one should be surprised to read their name in a journalistic story. It's important that the fact checker contact everyone (including companies, organizations, and institutions) named in a story, even if they weren't originally interviewed by the reporter (though the reporter should have at least tried to get in touch with them). The fact checker calls each source in turn to go over the relevant facts of the story, including everything the source originally told the reporter and any additional information from the story that concerns them.\nFor example, if the reporter names someone who was involved in a car accident, that name may be available on the police report included in the research package . But the fact checker will still make a reasonable effort to contact them to ensure that the report accurately conveys their experience and the spelling of their name. If the reporter reached out to that source earlier and was denied an interview or never heard back, they should have included copies of their unanswered emails in their research package, which the fact-checker will then save in their fact-checking folder . Depending on how significant a role the person plays in the story, it may also be appropriate for the fact checker to reach out again and request a fact-checking interview despite already having evidence that the source did not respond to the reporter. These new attempts to contact the source (emails, the times and dates of phone calls and voicemails, etc.) will also be recorded in the fact-checking folder.\nAn exception can be made for public information about public figures, which can often be confirmed with other authoritative sources. The fact checker does not need to arrange a fact-checking call with the prime minister, for example, to confirm a statement from a press conference\u2014though they may want to reach out to the prime minister's media team for a transcript of the press conference if one is not readily available elsewhere. Any private details about the prime minister's life, however, are ideally checked with them directly, not with their media team.\nOn top of the reporter's sources, the fact checker should consider calling anyone they think may help them confirm a fact, such as witnesses of an event or friends of an interviewed source. If the fact checker is struggling to check a story because of its technicality or complexity, they can reach out to an expert in the relevant field\u2014someone the reporter did not speak with\u2014and arrange a fact-checking interview to discuss the relevant facts. Many experts are happy to help, and if they're too busy to participate, they will often point you in the direction of others to ask.\nExperts can also provide general context for a piece beyond the specifics the fact checker needs to verify. Speaking with an expert early in the checking process is a good way of getting up to speed on the subject matter. For example, if you are fact-checking a story about nuclear physics that was written by an experienced science writer, it may help to speak with a nuclear physicist about the basics of their field before getting started.\nFact-checking calls with background sources and experts are always on background \u2014for the sake of the Two-Layer Principle , the fact checker would not include a quote from a fact-checking call in the text of the story without it going through additional verification. When contacting additional sources for verification purposes, the fact checker should be clear about why they are reaching out and explain that the call is purely for background corroboration, ensuring the source understands that they are not doing original reporting but instead trying to verify information reported by someone else.\nWe advise against using interview recordings and transcripts to check people's quotes and personal facts apart from in special cases (see Chapters Seven and Eight ), such as when it is impossible to reach someone directly. We also advise against emailing questions to a source unless there are good reasons for doing so (such as accessibility considerations, which we discuss in Chapter Eight ). Practically speaking, it's much easier to build a rapport when speaking with someone over the phone, on video, or in person. Establishing a baseline of trust is important for any journalistic endeavour, and fact-checking is no different: a conversation can go a long way in making a source feel comfortable, heard, and respected.\nOpen conversation is also most conducive to accuracy as it allows the fact checker to discuss the facts with the source in detail and, if a fact has been misstated, to make sure that they understand why the statement is wrong and what a correction would require. Sources will often ask for questions to be emailed, but if the fact checker explains the benefits of a live conversation, they will usually agree to a call instead.\nI want to go to people even when the interviews are taped, because things change or you could ask the question slightly differently and get a different answer.\n\u2014Peter Canby, former head of fact-checking, The New Yorker\nThose of us who were checking in the pre-web days can scarcely recall how we fact-checked without it. One way was by very quickly losing our fear of telephoning strangers, since that was our primary checking tool. My colleagues and I used to complain of getting \"checker's ear,\" a kind of red rash caused by hours of contact with a telephone receiver. Young checkers today, with the web at their fingertips, sometimes give me a terrified look when I suggest they should telephone a source, as much as to say, \"Is that allowed?\" E-mail and text-messaging have made the telephone call seem a tad antiquated, but the phone is still a powerful tool. And if your goal is to use fact-checking as a stepping stone to becoming a writer, talking to sources on the phone is excellent training.\n\u2014Cynthia Brouse, After the Fact: A Guide to Fact-Checking for Magazines and Other Media (2007)\nIf an interviewed source has not returned repeated calls or emails, the fact checker notifies the handling editor and head of research promptly so that they can decide on an alternative course of action to verify the fact. Fact checkers should avoid putting all of their eggs in one basket\u2014while waiting for one person to call back, call another and then another.\nIf a source is reluctant to participate in the fact-checking process, it can help to remind them that fact-checking is a service they are being provided: it is in their best interest to participate since doing so will help ensure that they are being accurately represented. Inform them that, if they refuse to participate, you will have to rely instead on audio recordings and interview notes (if there are any) to fact-check their contribution to the story. In some cases, however, a source's refusal to participate in fact-checking may mean that their contribution to the piece is modified or removed entirely. Preserve these exchanges for your records.\nConducting Fact-Checking Interviews\nAs soon as the fact checker has sent out requests to interviewed sources (even before any have responded), they begin to prepare for fact-checking calls. The fact checker does background research before every call, checking that none of the facts they're hoping to confirm with a source are obviously wrong.\nIdeally, the fact checker will be able to schedule fact-checking calls ahead of time and will prepare questions for sources while conducting documentary research. That way, they will be familiar with most of the story's gathered sources by the time a fact-checking call takes place.\nHere are the steps to preparing a list of fact-checking questions for an interviewed source:\nOpen a new document (a separate one for every source) and save it under the source's name and their assigned letter of the alphabet (this is important for Documentation ). At the top of the document, note the source's name and contact information.\nBelow their contact information, leave space to note the date(s) and time(s) you called the source, the medium you used (phone, Facebook message, Skype, Zoom, etc.), whether they answered or you left a voicemail, and any other pertinent details. It's important to document this process, even if it's a long line of unanswered voicemails, because you may later need to reference the date and time a conversation took place or prove that you made reasonable efforts to contact someone.\nRefer to your checking copy (and possibly your printed copy of the story, if you decided to print), in which you previously delineated the facts. Ideally, you will have underlined in colour, highlighted, or otherwise demarcated every fact in the piece that was attributed to the source in question. Read through the story and write down each of these facts separately in your interview document.\nMake sure you have not missed any facts that should be presented to the source during the call\u2014even if the reporter did not attribute them to that person. For example, if the reporter included a description of the food at a conference, and you know that the source you're speaking with attended the same conference, you could include that food fact in your list of questions for the source, to see if they remember the same thing. Make sure to note in your document (and clarify to the source in the call) that this information is not attributed to them in the text.\nNow that you have compiled the facts in your document, turn them into a numbered list, rephrasing the statements as questions as you go. You should begin your list of questions with the spelling of the source's name (if they are named in the story), their pronouns, their occupation and position (if relevant), and their date of birth (if relevant). (If they are confused about needing to provide their date of birth instead of simply confirming their age, explain that you need to make sure that their printed age will be accurate whenever the final version of the story is published; their date of birth likely won't be published.)\nWhen rephrasing facts as questions, paraphrase everything (including direct quotes) except for the most technical details and any personal language (see Chapter Five ). The facts in your list of questions should be presented in manageable chunks instead of full sentences. One statement from the story may be separated into several questions for a source: it's your job to parse out the facts from the statement, understand them, and check them individually during the call. Make sure to rephrase facts as yes-or-no questions or statements that can be confirmed or denied rather than as open-ended questions; this saves time and prevents confusion.\nBe ready to ask follow-up questions. Remember that your job will be done only when you understand what was right and wrong in a story, how a statement should be corrected, and why\u2014not just when you have a yes or no response about a fact.\nFor quotations, verify not only that the person said what has been attributed to them but also that its content is accurate. For example, \"The Statue of Liberty is the tallest human-built structure in the world,\" Randy said , has two main facts: (1) that Randy said this about the Statue of Liberty, and (2) that the Statue of Liberty is indeed the tallest human-built structure. If Randy has authority on the subject, he can be an authoritative source for both facts. If not, you will have to confirm the second one independently\u2014and during your phone call with Randy, you can ask for advice on how to confirm the statement. (A third and fourth fact to check would be: (3) that the Statue of Liberty is the correct name of the structure, and (4) that it is indeed human-built. These should be easy to check independently.)\nOnce you've written out the questions you plan to ask a source, rearrange them in your document. Don't list them in the same order in which the facts appear in the story\u2014journalistic stories tend to begin with the most dramatic or controversial details, which is not how we like to begin our interactions with sources.\nIt's best to begin by asking the least difficult or controversial questions. You can even include some buffer questions at the beginning of the call or throughout to help the source feel comfortable and ensure they understand how fact-checking works before getting into the grittier details. (For example, you can ask them to confirm a few details about their hometown or their workplace, even if those details won't make it into the final draft.) Categorizing questions by subject can also help structure your conversation. (We give more suggestions for ensuring the source's comfort during a fact-checking call in Chapter Seven .)\nEnd with the most controversial questions so that, if the source hangs up or refuses to continue, you minimize the number of facts for which you are left without confirmation.\nThe final version of your interview document should include the source's name, their contact information, a record of your communications with them (or at least communication attempts), and a numbered list of questions. The document should be assigned a letter in its title and saved along with the other interview documents in your fact-checking folder.\nI have a long-espoused philosophy of what I call controlled explosions, which is that, if you have somebody saying something that you know is likely to be controversial when it's published, oftentimes you'll have writers and editors say, \"Don't check that with the person because the person will completely blow up.\" The standard of that controlled explosion is: If they're going to blow up on us about this issue, it should happen before publication and not after publication.\n\u2014Peter Canby, former head of fact-checking, The New Yorker\nOnce you have prepared the document with your list of questions for someone, you are ready to conduct a fact-checking interview with them. (You can also send the list of questions to the source via email, if that's how you've decided to conduct the interview\u2014in which case you should make sure that you have written everything out clearly and with enough detail.)\nIt's helpful to begin each call with a quick explanation of the fact-checking process since sources may not be familiar with editorial fact-checking. The explanation might go something like this:\n\"My job as a fact-checker is to go through the story line by line and make sure that every statement is accurate and backed by credible sources. I call each person the reporter interviewed to make sure that we are quoting them and representing their work fairly and accurately. This fact-checking call is your opportunity to ensure we have understood everything you previously told the reporter. During the call, I will phrase every fact as a statement or question, and you can simply answer yes if it's accurate. If it's not accurate, please tell me why and what should be changed or clarified. Do you have any questions before we get started?\" Be sure to name the reporter so that the source knows whom you are referring to.\nEven though fact-checking can feel like an exact science, the phone calls you conduct should be respectful, polite, and conversational. The source should feel that you are a good listener who cares about their perspective. But you should also be clear about your role as a fact checker: the call should not feel so informal that the source misunderstands its purpose and starts giving longer or more open-ended answers. The source should understand your fact-checking standards and feel comfortable telling you when they're not confident enough to confirm a fact.\nNever misrepresent what you're doing, even with a source who may be at odds with the story. You don't need to give away the precise angle of the reporter's story unless it is directly relevant to the source you're speaking with\u2014the questions you ask during the call will likely give them all the information they need. But, if the source asks for more detail, you should be transparent about the subject matter and tone. (For example, if you're speaking with an environmental researcher to confirm general facts about the climate crisis, you can tell them that \"___ is writing about the negative effects of coal mining on the environment\" without needing to specify that ___ is writing about how a certain coal mine is directly responsible for the destruction of its environment. If you're speaking with an employee of the coal mine, however, you should be as specific as necessary for the sake of responsible communication.)\nTalking to someone who is going to be accused of wrongdoing in the article you're checking can be a delicate balance. You don't want to be too cautious and risk the source not understanding that they are being accused of something. But you also don't want to be so forthright that you are antagonizing the source unnecessarily\u2014there's a line between being direct and being combative, and you want to stay on the non-aggressive side, usually, as a fact checker. But, if the published piece is going to be accusing a person or a company of something, they should know that, and they should be given a chance to meaningfully respond to that accusation.\n\u2014Erin Sylvester, Managing Editor, The Walrus\nYou should have the list of questions open during your call with a source. Note the date and time of the call at the top of the document. While speaking with the source, note their answers beside each question, and note any clarification that a source may provide with their yes or no answer. Even if a source says yes to a question, it's important to note that confirmation in the document so that it doesn't look like you've skipped the question\u2014a detail that could become especially important in the case of a lawsuit. (We suggest writing a Y or a checkmark beside every confirmed statement.) Be as specific as possible about their responses: those details may be useful when the editor is rewriting a statement in the story. Always let your sources know that you may need to call again with further questions or follow-ups.\nNever promise a source that you will make a specific correction in a story\u2014all you can promise is that you will include their answers in your fact-checking records and that you will suggest all necessary corrections to the story's handling editor. If a source is pressing you for more, remind them of your role as a fact checker: you report to the handling editor and the head of research, who make the final decision. If they are still concerned, refer them to the head of research.\nDon't send the draft of a story (or an excerpt) to a source or read any passage to them verbatim (see Chapters Seven and Eight for some possible exceptions). You can tell sources who make such requests that the fact-checking process is meant to give them a chance to review any information that pertains to them without having undue influence on the story.\nYou can make audio recordings of any fact-checking interviews that you expect to be controversial or necessary for reference (for example, if the source denies having said something or if the reporter flags them as having been uncooperative). In general, however, you do not need to record a fact-checking phone call. As long as you are typing the source's answers into your interview document, that document will serve as a record of the conversation.\nIf a source denies having said something but you have the reporter's interview recording proving that they did, you should tell them that you have it and ask them about the discrepancy. Do so politely\u2014there may be good reasons for their quote to change, or they may simply have misremembered their conversation with the reporter. But, if you have reason to suspect that the source is trying to manipulate the facts (for example, if they are a politician who has been caught saying something problematic, and you have this on tape), you may nevertheless decide to stick with the interview recording. You should consult with the head of research before doing so and then inform the interviewed source of your decision.\nIf you cannot speak with a source\u2014because they refused to participate in fact-checking, they were unavailable in your time frame, or they did not respond to multiple requests for an interview\u2014you can rely on an audio recording of their interview provided by the reporter (assuming one was provided). First, listen to the audio recording for context. In a document, write down the name of the audio file and time stamps for relevant quotes. Transcribe the quotes verbatim, including the twenty seconds before and twenty seconds after. Save the document and audio recording in your fact-checking folder.\nIf there are no audio recordings of the interview, you can rely on the reporter's handwritten interview notes. However, if you are fact-checking a quote using handwritten notes, then you can confirm only what has been written down: if the notes are indecipherable scribbles and unconnected words, then they cannot confirm the grammatically correct sentence that the reporter has attributed to the source in their draft. Since handwritten notes are rarely able to capture what someone said verbatim, checking with handwritten notes often means you will have to suggest rewriting or paraphrasing sources' quotes in the text.\nDocumentation\nWe cannot overemphasize the importance of this final step in fact-checking: document everything and do it as you go . You will spend many hours (or days) at your desk trying to retrace your steps if you don't keep track of your sources and build your fact-checking folder in tandem with your research work. Avoiding this is worth the minor inconvenience of documenting your work every few minutes.\nDocumentation is an essential part of fact-checking: it helps with clarity and precision, it allows you to retrace your steps, and it means that any other member of the editorial team can return to your work\u2014even years later\u2014and identify the source of a fact. As previously mentioned, documentation is also helpful for legal protection, to establish that you and your colleagues practised responsible communication .\nThe fact-checking folder is a digital folder that contains all of the fact checker's work on a story, including every gathered source, every interview document, and PDFs of any email exchanges, as well as the checking and checked copies and the reporter's annotated draft. Typically, fact-checking folders are stored on the publication's internal server or shared network (Google Drive, for example), and they are kept for a minimum of three years, often much longer. The fact-checking folder title should include the fact checker's name, the reporter's name, and the date. It should also be organized into subfolders: one for gathered sources, one for interview documents, and one for all versions and working copies of the story itself.\nEvery gathered source (a document, an image, a screenshot of a website or social media page, etc.) should be assigned a number in its title. When a fact is attributed to a source, make a comment on that fact in your checking copy and note the number of the source in question. For example, the phrase That afternoon in the park, Allison and Viviane took a break from discussing the ethics of fact-checking and quietly sipped their coffees while looking up at the blue sky might have a comment on the words blue sky with the number 34, where 34 is the number given to a screenshot of the weather report for that day.\nInterviews are saved separately (one document for every source) in the fact-checking folder and assigned a letter. The questions in each interview document should be numbered starting at 1. So, if you comment \"34, A4, D9\" on blue sky , that means it was checked not only using source 34 (the weather report screenshot) but also question 4 in interview A and question 9 in interview D (likely the questions in your interviews with Allison and Viviane that confirm the appearance of the sky that day).\nIf you have identified a correction, include it in the same comment that lists the sources to which it is attributed. (A correction should always have at least one source attached to it.) Begin the comment with CORRECTION so that others can easily identify them when reviewing your checking copy. The correction should succinctly explain why the statement is wrong and, if possible, suggest a fix. Try to minimize changes to the story and include detailed information so that the handling editor has options for rewording the phrase or section in question. Keep your comments direct and to the point: the editor doesn't need to know the story of how you came to find out that the fact was wrong, but they do need to know how to fix it.\nYou should also include clarifications or other notes providing relevant contextual information that may affect the accuracy of the story. You can include those comments under the headings CLARIFICATION or NOTE . Trust your gut: anything that you think might be relevant to the accuracy or integrity of the story should be left as a comment for the record. Be clear in your comments about which changes are factually necessary and which are optional.\nYou may not be able to confirm or refute a particular fact in a story. In this case, make a comment using the label UNCONFIRMED . Your comment should include an explanation of why you did not find the reporter's source sufficient (if they provided one).\nAgain, all of this should be taking place while you fact-check\u2014the checking copy and fact-checking folder should both grow as you make your way through facts, sources, and interviews. Whenever you find a gathered source, save it immediately, give it a number, and add that number to relevant comments in your checking copy. If it confirms the fact, your work there is done; if it requires a correction, clarification, or other note, include that in the same comment. The same number-assignment process applies to any other relevant piece of information, such as audio recordings, screenshots, and images. Similarly, whenever you have conducted an interview, save that document immediately, give it a letter, and add that letter (plus the question number) to relevant comments in your checking copy.\nIn the end, your fact-checking folder should include every gathered source you've used in your fact-check (numbered), all of your correspondence and interviews with interviewed sources (lettered), the reporter's annotated draft for your records, and your checking copy. Eventually, it will also include your checked copy , the top read questions, and the post-input copy . (You can keep the printed copy with your working notes and coloured underlines/highlights in your own records as it may be helpful in the future, but there's usually no need to scan it and include it in your fact-checking folder\u2014it shouldn't contain any pertinent information that isn't also included in the checking copy.)\nBy the time you have checked every fact in the story, nearly every word of text in your document should be covered by comments that either attribute statements to sources or flags them as unconfirmed, plus corrections or clarifications as necessary.\nTopic-Specific Advice\nSome types of stories require special considerations or more technical fact-checking. We will discuss some of the most common examples in this section and others in more detail later on. If you are unsure about how to approach a certain story, it may help to consult others (such as the head of research or fellow fact checkers).\nOpinion and First-Person Pieces\nOpinion pieces are not exempt from fact-checking. The best reporting, no matter how descriptive or narrative-driven, is based on facts\u2014and those facts should be clearly presented in the reporter's annotated draft. Everyone is entitled to their opinion, but in journalism, people should give reasons for their opinions, and the fact checker's job is to make sure that those reasons stand the test of accuracy.\nSometimes, in their annotated draft, the reporter will label a fact as being \"on author.\" This term doesn't mean much on its own\u2014people use it in a variety of contradictory ways. If the reporter simply means that they remember reading the fact in question somewhere but now they can't find the source, you can ignore it (you still need a source). If they mean that this fact is their opinion, you should ask about the facts on which their opinion is based. Essentially, if a fact can be attributed to an authoritative source, it shouldn't remain \"on author.\"\nHowever, some reporters use \"on author\" to mean that they consider themselves to be the source of the information. This often happens in the context of memoirs. Our rule (which is a special case of the Personal Principle ) is that a fact can be \"on author\" in this sense only if it affects no one else, for example if the author is describing their own experience without naming any others or including any checkable external facts. Memoirs are discussed in greater detail in Chapter Six .\nOff-the-record and background sources\nMost publications ask reporters to always seek on-the-record interviews with named sources. But this is not always possible: some sources may provide information only on background, or they may ask for their names to be veiled for reasons of safety or privacy. If the reporter has come to an agreement with a source regarding their attribution status (ideally in consultation with other members of the editorial team), they should record the terms of that agreement and include it in their research package for the fact checker.\nDifferent reporters and sources have different understandings of what on background or off the record mean, so those terms alone are not enough to establish the specifics of the relationship between the source and the publication. Can they be named? Quoted? Used for background information only? Or not cited at all?\nHere is our list of attribution possibilities (inspired by the ones provided in The Chicago Guide to Fact-Checking , with some modifications):\nOn the record : Any information from the source can be published or aired and attributed to them.\nOn background : The information given by the source can be published, but the source can't be named.\nVeiled : The source is on background, and their quotes or information are not attributed to their full name (usually reporters use the person's first name only or their middle name instead, or sometimes they use a pseudonym). Alternatively, the reporter refers to the source's job or position instead of providing a name, the description of which must be agreed upon by the source and the reporter in advance.\nNot for attribution : The source is on background, and their quotes or information are not attributed to any name or personal description.\nOff the record : The information given by the source can be neither used nor attributed to them. But if the journalist is able to confirm that information with other sources, it can be published (though still not attributed to the original source).\nUsually, a source is accorded background (veiled or not for attribution) status only in cases where there is a clear and pressing need for anonymity, such as legitimate concern for the source's safety or the need to protect their personal privacy. (One special case is when you are conducting fact-checking interviews with additional people, such as subject-matter experts. In this case, the expert should understand that the fact-checking call is being conducted on background: they are helping you with your work, not being interviewed for the story itself.)\nNo matter what agreement the reporter made with the interviewed source, at least two people in the office should know the identity of the source so that the publication can assess the credibility of the information they have provided. Even if someone's identity cannot be published, it should not be withheld from the fact checker and head of research. It is the reporter's responsibility to communicate this policy to the source before the interview starts.\nYou should conduct fact-checking calls with everyone except off-the-record sources (to whom no information should be attributed, so there should be no reason for their names to appear in the reporter's research package in the first place). When fact-checking with a source on background, not for attribution, or whose name is veiled, make sure to lay out the terms of the attribution agreement again at the start and confirm that this is what they agreed on with the reporter. They may be nervous about speaking with a fact checker, so it is often helpful to remind them that the fact-checking call is as confidential as the original interview.\nIt's possible for the same person to have provided some information on the record and other information on background, so it is also important to indicate to the source which details are attached to their name and which are not.\nThe checker should confirm that any veiled source has chosen their own pseudonym or identification\u2014ideally their first or middle name. When ensuring someone's anonymity\u2014because of a publication ban or for reasons of safety or privacy\u2014remember that simply removing their name from the story is rarely enough: the reporter should also remove identifying information of any sort, which can include their workplace, their age, their location, and a variety of other descriptors.\nAny reader of the story should understand based on the text which sources are veiled and why. If you notice a source in the story who is mentioned only by first name or what seems to be a pseudonym without any explanation in the research package (and no in-text explanation for the reader), ask the handling editor and reporter about it before contacting the source for fact-checking.\nForeign-Language Reporting\nIdeally, a story will be assigned to a fact checker who speaks the same language as the story's main sources. But it is sometimes the case that no such fact checker is available, which means the publication may need to hire an interpreter or translator to help with fact-checking. Typically, this will be arranged by the head of research, although in some cases the fact checker may also be responsible for finding their own translator.\nWe recommend working with an interpreter as follows:\nOnce you have found an interpreter, arrange a call with them to explain the fact-checking process, especially how to conduct fact-checking interviews. (You will essentially go briefly through every major point in the Verification and Investigation section of this chapter, though the interpreter won't be doing all the work involved.)\nCreate the interview documents and write questions for the sources in a story as usual. Then send the interview documents for any foreign-language source to the interpreter, who will translate the questions.\nThe interpreter will contact the sources directly and ask them the questions in a recorded interview. They will then translate the answers back into English and send you the interview recording, transcript, and translation, and you will use those translated answers as usual in your fact-checking. Include all records in your fact-checking folder .\nSend any documentary source that is in a foreign language to the interpreter and tell them which fact you're hoping to confirm with it. Ask them to verify that the fact is corroborated by the source and to explain how and why it is (if it is). They should translate the relevant parts of the text and send that information back to you. Save the resulting documents and exchanges.\nThe translator should not suggest corrections or be involved in the fact-checking process more generally. They should report to the fact checker, who will compile the information in the fact-checking folder and make the appropriate corrections and comments in the checking copy .\nStories about Crime and the Law\nWhile fact-checking, keep an eye out for legally sensitive issues (which may vary depending on your location and may require consulting a media lawyer).\nThe questions below provide a helpful baseline for identifying when special legal care may be required during fact-checking. They also underline the difficulty of fact-checking a story that touches on legal or criminal affairs\u2014often, we need to fact-check the absence of something (absence of a verdict, absence of a publication ban, etc.), which can take substantial investigative work.\nStress Test for Legally Sensitive Stories\nIs the article saying something about someone that could harm their reputation or cause them embarrassment?\nIf so, have you checked with them whether the statement is accurate and whether they have any response to it? If the statement is true and pertinent but they are reluctant to comment, have you confirmed it with other credible sources, and can you stand behind the statement's accuracy if challenged in court?\nIs the story accusing anyone of illegal behaviour?\nAlways request a fact-checking interview with someone being accused of a crime. Even indirect accusations or accusations made of minor characters in a story are important to flag. The fact that the accusation takes up only one line of text (and doesn't name the person directly) won't prevent them from accusing you of libel if you don't have evidence for the accusation against them.\nIf the story refers to criminal offences, do you know whether the accused has been charged or convicted?\nIf they have not been convicted, the published story should not state or imply that they committed the offence\u2014at least not without making it absolutely clear that this has not yet been determined in court.\nHas any legal decision, such as a conviction, been appealed?\nSomeone can be convicted and later acquitted on appeal\u2014and you should catch this during fact-checking if the reporter missed it. If you cannot access court documents yourself, you can always ask the lawyers involved in the case.\nDid the author or editor provide all necessary legal documents to support statements made in the piece (such as statements of fact, sentencing documents, or court transcripts)?\nTry to access these documents and read them carefully\u2014they can include details you would otherwise miss.\nIf the word alleged is being used, is it modifying the right word in a sentence?\nShe was charged with the alleged crimes is very different from She was allegedly charged with the crimes , which is also different from She allegedly committed the crimes . Make sure you know which placement is right in the context of the story.\nIf the article is referring to a case being tried in court, is there a publication ban in place?\nIf the story identifies someone who is involved in a court case, make sure their identity is not protected by a publication ban. Some criminal court cases mandate that the accused or the complainant (or both) not be identified publicly. This is common for sexual-assault cases in Canada, for example. If a complainant's identity is bound by a court-ordered publication ban, that ban cannot be circumvented even if the complainant says they want their name published in the story.\nLifting a publication ban usually requires a court order, so it's best to consult a media lawyer before deciding whether the name of a complainant whose identity is protected by a ban can be published in a journalistic story. When faced with questions of anonymity, speak with the head of research and the handling editor\u2014and suggest that the story be read by a lawyer.\nScientific Papers and Journal Articles\nWe discuss science fact-checking in further detail in Chapter Four . For now, we will just note that, in any domain, it is important to differentiate between articles that have been peer-reviewed and those that have not been. (You should be able to find this information in the \"About Us\" page of the journal the paper was published in.) The preference is always for peer-reviewed work, though of course a peer-reviewed article may still have errors.\nAlways read a scientific paper or journal article in full before citing it. If you cannot access a scholarly paper that you need for your research, feel free to email the study's author\u2014academics are usually willing to share their work with journalists (and to explain it). You can also call a relevant expert who wasn't involved in the paper and ask them to help you understand and assess it.\nData and Statistics\nGenerally, there are three questions to ask about data: (1) what the raw data represents and how it was collected, (2) how that data was subsequently interpreted and analyzed (for example, by the authors of a scientific paper), and (3) how the reporter represented and used the data in their story.\nFact checkers should be aware of 1 and 2, which we discuss in detail in Chapter Four . But their main responsibility is to check 3: Is the reporter representing the data properly based on its source? Answering this question requires knowing how to accurately read statements about numbers, data, and statistics and how to identify common red flags. The following list of guidelines should help.\nGuidelines for Reporting Accurately on Data and Statistics\nMake sure you understand what the number refers to.\nLanguage describing numbers should be as precise as possible to avoid ambiguity. For example, the statement There are 300,000 Ojibwe living in Canada and the United States can be understood in various ways depending on what the author meant by Ojibwe . Is the number based on First Nation membership, on reserve population, on survey self-identification, on language speakers, or on other data? You won't be able to check the statement's accuracy until you know how to make it more precise.\nUse common sense.\nThis important piece of advice comes from Brooke Borel's The Chicago Guide to Fact-Checking. Asking yourself explicitly whether a number in a story makes sense can help you catch obvious (but common) errors. \"Say you're fact-checking a story that cites distances that came from a report that was written in a European country,\" Borel writes. \"Were the measurements correctly converted from kilometers to miles? Or say a story claims that 8 billion people have purchased the latest smartphone. As of 2016, the world population was around 7 billion. Did the writer mean 8 million?\"\nMake sure no crucial qualifying information is missing.\nMissing contextual information can make statements about numbers misleading, even if the numbers themselves are correct. For example, when the Washington Post tweeted an article in October 2020 saying that one volunteer in an Oxford coronavirus vaccine trial had died, the number was accurate, but the statement implied something inaccurate: the volunteer had been in the control group , meaning their death could not have been related to the vaccine.\nMake sure that approximations are appropriate.\nAn approximation can be accurate but misleading\u2014and that's cause for a correction. For example, the statement Less than 10 percent of COVID-19 transmissions have taken place outdoors would technically have been true in May 2021, but the real proportion of COVID-19 transmissions that had taken place outdoors at that time was closer to 0.1 percent . Less than 10 percent is not a good approximation of 0.1 percent, so it should be corrected.\nMake comparatives explicit and include the absolute numbers.\nStatements that include comparatives such as more than are often imprecise, which can make them difficult to fact-check. Take this headline from the American Cancer Society: \"More Black Women Die from Breast Cancer Than Any Other Cancer.\" The word more implies that there is a comparison here\u2014but it's not clear at all what is being compared. The types of cancer? The races of cancer patients? The death rates?\nFact checkers should look for answers in the absolute numbers. Further reading in the American Cancer Society report tells us that, in the US, Black women are more likely to die from breast cancer than white women, even though white women are more likely to receive a diagnosis of breast cancer than Black women. What's more, lung cancer has long been the leading cause of cancer death across the US, but since the number of lung cancer deaths has been in steep decline in recent years, in 2019, breast cancer became the leading cause of cancer death for Black women in particular.\nProviding this information in your fact-checking correction will allow the author and handling editor to rewrite the sentence in a way that emphasizes the fact they actually meant to communicate.\nCheck every instance of \"percent\" and \"percentage point.\"\nWhen discussing an increase or decrease in percentages, it can be easy to trip over language; always ask yourself whether the right terminology is being used.\nA percent change refers to a number's relative change. For example, if I ate 50 chocolate bars last year, and I ate 70 this year, then my chocolate bar consumption increased 40 percent from year to year.\nA percentage-point change describes an absolute change in percentages . Say 10 out of the 50 chocolate bars I ate last year had nuts in them; that's 20 percent with nuts. This year, I still ate only 10 bars with nuts, but since I ate 70 bars in total, that's only about 14 percent with nuts. That means my nut-chocolate-bar consumption rate decreased from 20 to about 14 percent\u2014so it decreased roughly 6 percentage points and 30 percent. (My annual absolute nutty chocolate-bar consumption, however, remained unchanged: I ate 10 a year.)\nProperly differentiate between causation and correlation.\nCorrelation between two variables means that they have some kind of relationship\u2014as one variable changes, so does the other. Causation is more precise: it means that one variable's changes cause the other to change. Not all correlation is causation, and you should make sure that the right vocabulary is being used (or implied) in a reporter's work.\nOne famous example of correlation draws on criminology research: strangely enough, whenever ice cream sales increase in a region, so does the violent crime rate\u2014the two numbers are correlated. But that does not mean ice cream sales cause violent crime or vice versa. Rather, the correlation probably comes from the fact that, when it's warm out, people eat more ice cream, and they also spend more time outside, increasing the likelihood that they will encounter crime. This is an example of correlation that does not imply causation.\nPay particular attention to the use of statistical and technical language.\nScientists and statisticians may describe a result as \"significant\" or \"non-significant,\" they may refer to its \"p-value,\" or they may use other language with precise statistical meanings. The best way to check whether the reporter has conveyed such facts accurately is to refer to the original report where the language came from (most scientific papers will include helpful explanations of what the numbers mean)\u2014or even to speak with one of the authors. Since p-values are particularly contentious in some scientific circles, Borel suggests that, \"when in doubt, a fact-checker should call a statistician to help identify whether a paper is using the p-value honestly and correctly.\"\nIf any of these examples feels overwhelming, don't worry\u2014what's most important is that you can identify potential problems, even if you can't solve them on your own. You can always ask colleagues for help sorting through numbers and statistical statements, or you can call an expert on background for advice.\nAfter the Fact-Check\nFact-checking a story can take anywhere from one day to one month (and even longer for books and other longform works); it depends on a variety of factors, including the availability of sources for interviews and the complexity of the topic at hand.\nOnce you're satisfied that you've finished your work and you have a fact-checking folder and checking copy ready to go, you can let the head of research know that you're ready for a top read.\nTop Read\nTypically, the top read happens after the fact-checking folder and checking copy are complete and before any corrections have been input into the story. The top reader can be anyone qualified to assess the work, usually another fact checker or the head of research (but not the handling editor or the reporter, whose proximity to the story may prevent them from making accurate assessments of the fact check).\nThe point of the top read is to lend a fresh set of eyes to the fact-checked piece to make sure that nothing was missed by the fact checker. Together, the top reader and fact checker go over the checking copy and fact-checking folder. The top reader checks that every fact has been accounted for, assesses the kinds of sources used, ensures that the fact checker's comments are clear, and checks for proper formatting. They can also provide a second opinion on any parts the fact checker found particularly challenging\nThe top reader does not need to recheck the entire story or go through every source; they usually focus on areas that are most likely to be controversial or prone to error. Usually, a top reader is more thorough on the first few pages, to get an idea of the fact check, and then they use their judgment for the rest of the story. The top reader will often ask the fact checker clarificatory questions: \"How do we know this?\"; \"Are you sure this source is appropriate and credible?\"; \"Have we followed up with the original source about this?\" By the time you have finished your fact check and entered the top read stage, you should be ready to answer these questions; if not, your fact-checking work is not complete.\nThe length of the top read depends on the length and complexity of the piece, but it usually takes a couple of hours. At the end, the top reader gives the fact checker a list of statements and sources to follow up on and questions to answer\u2014usually minor clarifications that they will have to investigate or rectify in their checked copy, sometimes more substantial revisions. (It's very rare that the top reader will have no comments or follow-ups to suggest\u2014just like it's very rare that the fact checker will have no corrections to suggest. We're all human!) This list of follow-ups should be saved in the fact-checking folder for the publication's records.\nThe fact checker completes the top reader's follow-ups and adjusts their fact-checking folder and checking copy appropriately. Then they're ready for input.\nFact-Check Input\nOnce the fact check is complete, the fact checker builds the checked copy . This is a version of the checking copy from which all source annotations have been removed\u2014only corrections, clarifications, and other notes for the editor should remain. (This is because the handling editor does not need to know sourcing details for any fact that has been confirmed; they are concerned only with the details that require changes.)\nThe fact checker sends the checked copy to the handling editor and lets them know that they are ready for fact-check input . Typically, the editor will meet with the fact checker or speak with them over the phone, and the two will walk through every comment in the piece. This is the fact checker's opportunity to explain why certain\u00a0changes need to be made and help the editor decide on accurate modifications to the text. The fact checker and the editor note what has been changed and how in order to record the changes in the fact-checking folder. We recommend doing so by creating a duplicate of the checked copy, called the post-input copy , where every change made by the editor is highlighted. Save the post-input copy in the fact-checking folder.\nDuring input, the handling editor may decide that a suggested correction isn't necessary; if you agree, then that correction can be stetted \u2014which essentially means that it has been overridden. In your input copy, make sure to note which changes are made and which are stetted. Speak up to editors if they override a correction that you believe is necessary. If there is a disagreement, make sure you've provided the editor with all of the information that has led you to believe a correction must be made. If you and the handling editor can't come to an agreement, the head of research will step in and make the final decision.\nOnce fact-check input is complete, the story is out of your hands: the handling editor will send the fact-checked version back to the reporter for the sake of transparency (and perhaps to ask for further modifications, if appropriate), and the story will enter production. If any changes are made to the story after that point, you may be called on to fact-check new details ( ideally nothing major at this late point in the editorial process). Make sure to include any additions in your fact-checking folder.\nFact-Check Read\nYou will see the story at least one more time after fact-check input, during your fact-check read . This is a chance for you to read the final draft of the story, after it has been copy-edited, formatted, proofread, and all the rest. You don't need to go through the entire fact-check again; just read the story to ensure that everything still seems accurate. Double-check anything new or suspicious, and input any changes with the handling editor. Keep a record of your work (including any new sources, corrections, and inputs or stets ) in your fact-checking folder. Once your fact-check read is complete, your job is done, and your fact-checking folder is saved to the publication's archive. Congratulations! The story is ready for publication.\nVariations and Adapting to Constraints\nThe fact-checking methodology outlined in this chapter sets a high standard, which not every publication can meet given limited resources and time. Fact-checking thoroughly can take a huge amount of time and energy, which makes it incompatible with the constraints of daily journalism and the small size of most newsrooms today. Daily newsrooms lack the time to conduct a thorough fact-check on every breaking story before publishing it. But this doesn't mean that no fact-checking is possible. Below, we highlight some of the compromises publications have made in order to allow for some kind of fact-checking process\u2014even if it doesn't meet the ideal we've described.\nWhatever version of editorial fact-checking a publication adopts, if the modifications made to the process introduce caveats to the reliability of the published content or affect how readers should relate to it\u2014for example, if only certain stories or kinds of facts are ever checked, or if sources aren't given the opportunity to confirm their quotes\u2014then these modifications should be disclosed publicly. This transparency can look different in different contexts. Sometimes, it makes sense to acknowledge that a story was fact-checked differently from the standard within the text of the story itself; other times, a publication can inform readers about its fact-checking methodology in its house policy or ethics statements. The important thing is to ensure that, when a story is described as \"fact-checked,\" we all agree on what that means, and we know when and why exceptions to that definition have been made.\nWe have categorized the variations below by which ones we think should be disclosed to the reader if the publication is claiming to publish fact-checked journalism. All publications should have responsive and rigorous corrections policies and an open line of communication with sources and their audience.\nModifications that do not need to be disclosed:\nNo head of research or fact-checking department\nMost publications that are not heavily invested in fact-checking do not have a separate fact-checking department or full-time head of research . That doesn't necessarily mean they don't work with fact checkers\u2014but, when they do, there may be no one overseeing the fact checkers' work full-time, and the fact checkers may be freelancers hired to work on individual stories at a time. In these cases, the fact checker typically works directly with the handling editor on the story, and any complications are sorted out between them, without any outside review process. The more review there can be of fact checkers' work, the better\u2014-especially for decisions about source accommodations and disagreements between the fact checker and the reporter or handling editor.\nNo review steps\nA publication may decide to omit the review of the research package and/or the top read from their editorial process in order to save time and resources. If this is the case, we recommend that the fact checker reread their final check with an eye to those smaller details.\nFact-checking and editing at the same time\nSome publications send a piece into fact-checking before the final draft is ready and continue to edit the story while fact-checking is underway. We advise against this as it creates more work for the fact checker: they have to keep track of what information has already been corroborated and what new information needs verification. This situation makes it much more likely that important details will be missed and errors will be published. If possible, the handling editor should wait for the most final version of a piece possible before sending it into fact-checking. If fact-checking needs to happen simultaneously, make sure to keep detailed records and ensure that every fact (including the most recent additions) has been checked before the story is published.\nModifications that should likely be disclosed to sources and the audience:\nUsing audio recordings and transcripts instead of calling people back\nA publication with a tight schedule and few fact checkers on staff may rely on interview audio recordings and transcripts instead of calling people back. Doing this is of course better than not checking quotes at all, but it prevents the fact checker from updating sources' quotes with new information or accounting for missed context or nuance in the reporter's presentation of the quote. This practice is generally inadvisable: the fact checker's responsibility to call every interviewed source in a story is one of the most important parts of the job (as we emphasize in Chapter Eight .\nIf this is your publication's policy, make sure that interviewed sources know about it in advance so that they can consent to their interview being recorded and transcribed and to those transcriptions serving as an official record. You may still need to follow up if any clarificatory questions arise during your fact-checking that cannot be answered by reading through the transcript.\nGiving some stories \"light checks\"\nSometimes, editors, publishers, or reporters ask for a story to be given a \"light\" check. This may mean that they want you to look only at the spellings of proper nouns and any dates or figures. Or it may mean that they want you to contact only sources who are seen as important. Standards vary, but many publications assign what they consider to be light checks for the sake of resource management.\nFor example, you might be asked to fact-check a memoir that has to be rushed for web publication without verifying the facts that involve the author's personal experience. Or, when fact-checking a book review under a tight deadline, you might trust that the author has understood the gist of the book without having to look at it yourself. (If fact-checking must be rushed, a preferable way to approach such a story would be to contact the book's author or publisher and confirm details about the book over the phone instead of reading it in full.) In these cases, you should be pragmatic: prioritize the most important and controversial details.\nIt is up to you to identify which kinds of \"light check\" modifications need to be disclosed; most of the time, they do.\nFact-checking only certain stories\nTo cut costs and save time, some publications fact-check only certain stories\u2014typically those submitted by freelance reporters (instead of staff reporters), those published in print (instead of online), or those that are especially controversial or legally sensitive (in order to avoid lawsuits).\nHere, transparency is key. If this policy is not disclosed to readers, then the audience will not be empowered to properly assess and compare the publication's stories, which are not all being held to the same factual standard.\nThe copy editor as fact checker\nSome publications do not hire fact checkers but still claim to publish fact-checked journalism because they ask the copy editor to do the job. When fact-checking falls to the copy editor, it usually means that the fact check can't be done as thoroughly as it would be by someone whose role was dedicated to checking.\nIdeally, the copy editor maintains some separation between copy-editing and fact-checking, and they call sources back (or at least listen to interview recordings) and conduct background research. But, when publications have this arrangement, the copy editor is often asked to check only the facts that fall under the copy editor's domains, such as name spellings and dates. In these cases, they can't really be called a fact checker according to the standards of this guide\u2014and this should certainly be disclosed to readers and sources.\nThe reporter as fact checker\u2014or no fact checker at all\nMany publications do not have the resources to employ fact checkers, especially in the world of daily news, where there is no time for a second person to go through a reporter's work before it is published\u2014though editors may do some checking of their own for legally or otherwise sensitive stories.\nThough we do not recommend that the reporter fact-check their own work, since mistakes are likely to be missed, this is of course preferable to there being no fact-check at all. At the very least, reporters should be supported and given the resources to fact-check their own reporting before it is published. And any publication that does not support any kind of fact-checking process should not claim to publish fact-checked journalism.\nWhat's Next?\nNow you know what we consider to be the ideal methodology for fact-checking a piece of journalism. If you are interested in learning more about the standard practice, we advise reading the helpful guides by Cynthia Brouse ( After the Fact: A Guide to Fact-Checking for Magazines and Other Media ), Sarah Harrison Smith ( The Fact Checker's Bible: A Guide to Getting It Right ), and Brooke Borel ( The Chicago Guide to Fact-Checking ). The Knight Science Journalism Program at MIT also has a variety of helpful resources online for learning and teaching editorial fact-checking.\nIn the following chapters, we focus on topics that previously published fact-checking guides have not covered: the cases where ethical and other considerations make straightforward fact-checking counterproductive or impossible. These considerations won't come up for every fact check\u2014it's unlikely that you will need to navigate trauma-informed interviewing practices or address systemic oppression while fact-checking a 250-word article on toothpaste. But the rest of this guide should help you think through complicated ethical issues if and when they do come up in your work; help you be more informed and capable of advocating for factual accuracy in future conversations with your editorial colleagues; and help you identify when standard practices need to be questioned or reconsidered.\n\u00a9 Allison Baker and Viviane Fairbank 2022\n2.

The president's closest advisers \u2014 stunned after the debacle in the Oval Office \u2014 huddled around the Cabinet Room's oblong table for lunch, sources familiar with the events told CBS News.\u00a0 Vice President JD Vance, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, National Security Adviser Mike Waltz, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, special envoy to Ukraine and Russia, retired Gen. Keith Kellogg, and White House chief of staff Susie Wiles were joined by Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina as the group rehashed what had just transpired.\u00a0 They shared disbelief over what one source characterized as Zelenskyy badgering the president. Another official said that, had Zelenskyy kept his disagreements behind closed doors, the blowup wouldn't have happened.\nDuring the contentious meeting, Mr. Trump and Vance took an aggressive and sometimes belittling tone with Zelenskyy after he expressed doubt over whether Russian President Vladimir Putin would honor a potential peace agreement given that he had repeatedly violated ceasefire deals, including the Minsk agreements , leading up to Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine. In the hours after Zelenskyy was asked to leave the White House at the behest of Rubio and Waltz \u2014 with a joint press conference scrapped \u2014 there was discussion about whether the Ukrainian leader should fire whoever may have advised him on Friday's strategy. CBS News has reached out to Ukrainian officials for comment.\u00a0 Some of the Trump team's frustration targeted Zelenskyy's chief adviser, Andriy Yermak, whom they believed had undermined negotiations in recent days. Others said they weren't so sure it was an adviser problem.\u00a0 It wasn't the first time Zelenskyy had clashed with his American counterpart. President Biden once hung up on Zelenskyy because of the Ukrainian president's perceived combativeness, sources familiar with the call told CBS News. The friction was kept private and officials insist the dispute was over policy \u2014 not basic facts like which country had started the war.\nIn recent days, there were signs the multibillion-dollar critical minerals deal might not come to fruition. Neither side had signed preliminary paperwork that typically precedes an economic agreement of this scale. On Friday morning, Graham, Republican Sen. Roger Wicker of Mississippi, Democratic Sen. Amy Klobochar of Minnesota, and others met privately with Zelenskyy at the Hay-Adams Hotel in Washington, D.C. They recommended that Zelenskyy avoid being contentious, say thank you and sign the deal without changes, according to people in the room.\u00a0 Some Trump advisers were nervous the deal might go south before the ceremonial signing, but felt confident by the time Mr. Trump greeted Zelenskyy. They viewed it as an economic security guarantee, a shared investment binding the U.S. and Ukraine for a generation, sources said.\u00a0 Zelenskyy had appealed to the West for ceasefire and post-war security guarantees, which were not explicitly included in the minerals deal. In Kyiv last month, Treasury Secretary Bessent had described the agreement as the foundation for a larger peace deal, and an economic partnership that would provide once the conflict is over a 'long term security shield for all Ukrainians.' However, the deal itself was not a ceasefire or peace agreement. Bessent described it as a very strong signal to Russian leadership of American commitment. Kyiv had hoped for security guarantees up front that would secure a pledge by the U.S. to help keep the long term peace and prevent Russia from invading again. The White House expected to finalize a version of the deal Friday that was essentially the same as one Bessent presented to Kyiv in mid-February. One modification: a provision was removed that would have placed a $500 billion cap on the value of minerals Ukraine would provide. The change was made at Ukraine's request because Zelenskyy disliked the narrative that Ukraine owed a certain repayment for past aid, people familiar with the deal said.\u00a0 \"We were trying to make it reasonable for them,\" one Trump adviser said. Trump's team privately discussed how they liked the new version better because it meant a deal could be worth more than initially conceived.\nThe minerals deal was a concept Graham had circulated as an avenue to create a new, mutually beneficial relationship for the two countries. Zelenskyy had presented it to Mr. Trump, at Graham's urging, at a meeting at Trump Tower in September. But on Friday, staff quietly removed the formal ceremonial set-up from the East Room \u2014 a conference table and two podiums, and two sets of binders with unsigned documents.\u00a0 Zelenskyy on Saturday arrived in London to meet with sympathetic European allies. No plans had been made for Mr. Trump and Zelenskyy to speak again.\u00a0 In the meantime, America remains the most significant military and financial backer of Ukraine in its war against Russian aggression. There is $3.85 billion in military equipment already designated for delivery to Ukraine, and it is not clear if Mr. Trump will still clear it for delivery.\u00a0 \"They are fortunate it's not off already,\" a senior U.S. official told CBS News.\u00a0 As for any further pledges of U.S. support from the Republican-led Congress, House Speaker Mike Johnson recently said there's no appetite for it.\nMore from CBS News\nRep.

Get more news Live on \u00a0/\u00a0 Updated \u00a0 By Rebecca Shabad and Nnamdi Egwuonwu WASHINGTON \u2014 A White House meeting that was intended to kick off negotiations on a deal over Ukraine\u2019s rare earth minerals devolved Friday into a remarkable confrontation, with President Donald Trump and Vice President JD Vance chastising Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and telling him he wasn\u2019t grateful enough to the United States. The Oval Office shouting match has for now shattered hopes for the minerals deal, which Trump and his allies had presented as an important step forward for Ukraine on the road to peace with Russia more than three years after the war began. \"He disrespected the United States of America in its cherished Oval Office,\" Trump said in a post on his Truth Social website after the meeting ended. \"He can come back when he is ready for Peace.\" Follow live politics coverage here Trump dug in further hours later, telling reporters that Zelenskyy \u201coverplayed his hand\u201d and accusing the Ukrainian president of \u201clooking to go on and fight, fight, fight.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re not looking for somebody that\u2019s going to sign up a strong power and then not make peace because they feel emboldened,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWe\u2019re not looking to go into a 10-year war and play games. We want peace.\u201d After departing the White House, Zelenskyy posted on X, \u201cThank you America, thank you for your support, thank you for this visit. Thank you @POTUS, Congress, and the American people. Ukraine needs just and lasting peace, and we are working exactly for that.\u201d During a Fox News interview Friday evening, Zelenskyy reiterated his appreciation of U.S. support but rebuffed calls to apologize for his comments at the White House. \u201cI think that we have to be very open and very honest. And I\u2019m not sure that we did something bad,\u201d Zelenskyy said. Secretary of State Marco Rubio is among the Trump allies who have called on Zelenskyy to issue an apology, telling CNN in an interview Friday night that Zelensky should \u201capologize for turning this thing into the fiasco for him that it became.\u201d \u201cThere was no need for him to go in there and become antagonistic,\u201d Rubio said. \"We were hoping that that meeting would begin by: 'Thank you for everything you\u2019ve done for us. We wouldn\u2019t be where we are today without you. We wouldn\u2019t even have a chance to negotiate a piece without the help you gave us.'\" Despite Trump\u2019s assertion that Zelenskyy \u201cdoesn\u2019t have the cards\u201d to negotiate, the Ukrainian leader remained adamant Friday night that security guarantees be included in any agreement to end the war, as well as the rare earth minerals deal drafted by the Trump administration. The security guarantees, he added in the Fox News interview, are critical given what he described as a long history of Russian President Vladimir Putin disregarding ceasefire agreements. Zelenskyy made many of those same points during his meeting with Trump and Vance when the cameras were rolling. A White House official told NBC News that Trump and other U.S. officials later asked Zelenskyy to leave the White House, saying that he was not welcome back on Friday. Zelenskyy abruptly departed the White House, and a planned joint news conference with the two leaders was called off. The Oval Office exchange underscored the tension that has emerged between the United States and Ukraine \u2014 along with many of its European allies \u2014 over the tougher line that Trump has taken toward the country since coming into office. He has called Zelenskyy a \u201c dictator \u201c and falsely said that Ukraine, not Russia, started the war . Rubio said Friday that frustrations over Zelenskyy's behavior are not new, pointing to reporting by NBC News that President Biden lost his temper and raised his voice while on the phone with the Ukrainian leader, according to four people familiar with the June 2022 call. \"These frustrations are not unique to President Trump,\" Rubio said. Zelenskyy told Fox News that he believes his relationship with Trump could still be salvaged. But he said in the interview that he wants to see signs of Trump favoring Ukraine over Russia. \"I want really, him to be more at our side,\" Zelenskyy said. \"The war began when Russia brought this war to our country. And they are not right.\" President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy meet in the Oval Office on Friday. Saul Loeb / AFP - Getty Images The verbal skirmish in the Oval Office began after Vance said that the path to peace between Russia and Ukraine is diplomacy. Zelenskyy disagreed, noting that Russia had broken agreements with his government in the past. \"He killed our people, and he didn't exchange prisoners,\" Zelenskyy said about Putin. \"What kind of diplomacy, JD, you are speaking about? What do you mean?\" \"I\u2019m talking about the kind of diplomacy that\u2019s going to end the destruction of your country,\" Vance shot back. \"I think it\u2019s disrespectful for you to come into the Oval Office to try to litigate this in front of the American media right now.\" Vance has long opposed U.S. aid to Ukraine. As a senator, he voted against a $95 billion foreign aid package that included substantial funding for Ukraine. As a Senate candidate, Vance said in a 2022 podcast , \u201cI don\u2019t really care what happens to Ukraine one way or another.\u201d When Vance told Zelenskyy on Friday that Ukraine has \"manpower problems\" in recruiting troops, Zelenskyy challenged Vance, noting he had never even been to his country. \"I've actually watched and seen the stories,\" Vance responded. \"And I know, what happens is you bring people, you bring them on a propaganda tour, Mr. President.\" \"Do you think that it's respectful to come to the Oval Office of the United States of America and attack the administration that is trying to prevent the destruction of your country?\" he added. Zelenskyy said that everyone has \"problems\" during the war and suggested that the U.S. doesn't feel the effects of the war because of the \"nice ocean\" between the two countries. He said the U.S. may not feel the effects now, but added, \"You will feel it in the future.\" \"Don't tell us what we're going to feel because you're in no position to dictate that,\" Trump said, raising his voice and pointing his finger at Zelenskyy. \"You're not in a good position.\" \u201cYou\u2019re gambling with World War III,\" Trump said. \"And what you\u2019re doing is very disrespectful to the country \u2014 this country.\u201d \"I've empowered you to be a tough guy,\" Trump said. \"And I don't think you'd be a tough guy without the United States. And your people are very brave, but you're either going to make a deal or we're out, and if we're out, you'll fight it out.\" Trump and Vance repeatedly suggested that Zelenskyy was not thankful enough to the United States for its assistance. \"You're not acting at all thankful, and that's not a nice thing,\" Trump said at one point. \"Have you said thank you once, this entire meeting?\" Vance also asked. Zelenskyy has repeatedly thanked the United States for its help. In December 2022, he spoke before both chambers of Congress and his first words were: \"Thank you so much. Thank you so much for that. Thank you. It\u2019s too much for me. All this for our great people. Thank you so much. Dear Americans, in all states, cities and communities, all those who value freedom and justice, who cherish it as strongly as we Ukrainians in our cities, in each and every family, I hope my words of respect and gratitude resonate in each American heart.\" Republican allies of the president largely applauded Trump after the meeting. Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., an outspoken critic of Putin who has supported U.S. aid to Ukraine, called the meeting a \u201ccomplete, utter disaster,\u201d\u00a0and said, \u201cI don\u2019t know if we can ever do business with Zelenskyy again.\u201d Speaking to reporters outside the White House, Graham \u2014 who attended a bipartisan group of senators\u2019 meeting with Zelenskyy earlier Friday \u2014 said the Ukrainian leader \"either needs to resign and send somebody over that we can do business with, or he needs to change.\" Zelenskyy rebuffed Graham's suggestion during his Fox News interview, stating that only the Ukrainian people can demand his resignation. Meanwhile, Trump and Vance\u2019s handling of the meeting stunned Democrats, who said that they were kowtowing to Putin. \u201cWhat we saw in the Oval Office today was beyond disgraceful. Trump and Vance berating Zelenskyy \u2014 putting on a show of lies and misinformation that would make Putin blush \u2014 is an embarrassment for America and a betrayal of our allies. They\u2019re popping champagne in the Kremlin,\u201d wrote Sen. Chris Coons, D-Del., who was also part of the meeting with Zelenskyy on Friday morning. Rep. Seth Moulton, D-Mass., said during an interview on MSNBC that \"this is the beginning of the end. Putin starts not only walking all over Ukraine, but walking all over Europe.\" Trump has \u201ccompletely thrown out American tradition, Republican tradition, everything they\u2019ve run on for decades just to be beholden to Putin.\u201d Zelenskyy's visit had been expected to focus in large part on a potential deal for the U.S. to access Ukraine's rare-earth minerals, which are used to make a variety of tech products. During a Cabinet meeting on Wednesday, Trump said that the two countries had made progress on an agreement that would grant the U.S. a significant ownership stake in Ukraine\u2019s rare-earth minerals as a form of repayment for Washington\u2019s support of Kyiv since Russia's invasion. U.S. officials initiated peace talks with Russian negotiators this month in Saudi Arabia, with Secretary of State Marco Rubio leading the U.S. delegation. It was the first time Russian and American officials had met in person during the Trump administration with the express intent of bringing an end to the war in Ukraine. Trump has long accused Zelenskyy of taking undue advantage of the U.S. and goading then-President Joe Biden into spending billions of U.S. dollars on a war that \u201c couldn\u2019t be won .\u201d The minerals agreement, Trump has argued, would serve as reimbursement for the nearly $66 billion in military assistance the U.S. has provided Ukraine over the past three years, and it could create an \u201c economic partnership \u201d between the two countries. Ukraine has some of the world\u2019s largest reserves of titanium and iron ore . Many of the minerals, however, are in areas controlled by Russian troops, according to U.S. officials. Russia has proposed a similar deal that would give the U.S. ownership of rare-earth minerals and valuable metals in Russian-controlled Ukrainian territory, an idea that both Trump and Putin have signaled interest in. Zelenskyy this month rebuffed the initial U.S. offer on rare-earth minerals, saying it did not include strong enough security guarantees for Ukraine. The rejection, paired with Zelenskyy's insistence that Ukrainian officials be involved in U.S.-Russia talks to end the war, drew Trump\u2019s fury . After Zelenskyy accused Trump of living in a Russian \u201cdisinformation bubble,\u201d Trump maligned him as \u201ca Dictator without Elections,\u201d arguing without evidence that Zelenskyy decided to postpone elections as Ukraine battles Russia because of low popularity numbers. Trump later told Fox News that Zelenskyy would hamstring his efforts to negotiate an end to the war. \u201cI don\u2019t think he\u2019s very important to be at meetings, to be honest with you. He\u2019s been there for three years. He makes it very hard to make deals,\u201d Trump said. Rebecca Shabad Rebecca Shabad is a politics reporter for NBC News based in Washington.

While the Ukrainians were waiting in the other room, national security adviser Mike Waltz and Secretary of State Marco Rubio told them to leave. The official said Zelenskyy was trying to smooth things over and asked for a reset, but Mr. Trump and other administration officials were offended by Zelenskyy's behavior.\u00a0 The contentious meeting exposed severe rifts between the U.S. and Ukraine, upending the planned signing of a rare minerals deal between the two countries as Mr. Trump pressures Ukraine to agree to end the war that Russia began. During the course of the meeting, Mr. Trump threatened Zelenskyy to make a deal with Russia or \"we're out,\" and Vance accused the Ukrainian leader of being \"disrespectful.\" Later in the day, high level administration sources confirmed to CBS that there have been discussions about whether U.S. will keep sending military aid to Ukraine after the Oval Office clash between Mr. Trump and Zelenskyy. \"They are fortunate it is not off already,\" a senior U.S. official said to CBS News on the status of U.S. aid to Ukraine.\nThe meeting veered into tense exchanges after Vance said during the course of the meeting that the world has reached this point in part because of the Biden administration's actions, and said it was time for diplomacy.\u00a0 Zelenskyy challenged Vance on this point, noting there had been other ceasefire agreements Russian President Vladimir Putin had broken \u2014 and not just during the Obama administration. During Mr. Trump's administration\u00a0 Putin violated \u00a0the Minsk ceasefire agreements, which\u00a0 had been signed \u00a0by both Russia and Ukraine. And Zelenskyy pointed out that he had signed an agreement with Putin over the exchange of prisoners, \"but he didn't do it.\" \"What kind of diplomacy, JD, you are speaking about,\" Zelenskyy asked Vance. Vance retorted that it was \"disrespectful\" for Zelenskyy to try to \"litigate\" his case in front of the American media.\n\"You should be thanking the president for trying to bring an end to this conflict,\" Vance told Zelenskyy.\nHeated Trump-Zelenskyy meeting in Oval Office | Special Report\n21:01\nZelenskyy asked Vance if he'd ever been to Ukraine.\u00a0 Vance said he's watched videos of what's happened in Ukraine, accusing Zelenskyy of bringing people on a \"propaganda tour\" when they visit Ukraine.\u00a0 \"Do you think that it's respectful to come to the Oval Office of the United States of America and attack the administration that is trying to prevent the destruction of your country?\" Vance asked.\u00a0 Zelenskyy, noting that for now, the U.S. is separated from the fighting by an ocean, said of the war, \"You don't feel it now, but you'll feel it in the future.\"\u00a0 \"You don't know that,\" Mr. Trump argued. \"You don't know that. Don't tell us what we're going to feel. We're trying to solve a problem. Don't tell us what we're gonna feel, because you're in no position to dictate that. You're in no position to dictate what we're going to feel. We're going to feel very good.\"\u00a0 \"You don't have the cards right now,\" Mr. Trump said, as Zelenskyy continued to interject and disagree. \"With us, you start having cards. Right now, you don't have your playing cards, your playing cards \u2014 you're gambling with the lives of millions of people. \"You're gambling with World War III. You're gambling with World War III.\"\n\"Have you said 'thank you' once, this entire meeting? No, in this entire meeting, have you said 'thank you,'\" Vance said.\u00a0 Zelenskyy kept a measured tone throughout the entire exchange, even as Mr. Trump and Vance at times raised their voices.\u00a0 \"Please,\" Zelenskyy said. \"You think that if you will speak very loudly about the war\u2014\" Mr. Trump cut off Zelenskyy and said his country is in \"big trouble\" but \"you have a damn good chance of coming out okay because of us.\"\u00a0 Zelenskyy said his country has stayed strong from the beginning of the war, and Ukrainians are thankful.\u00a0 \"It's going to be a very hard thing to do business like this,\" Mr. Trump said, as Vance again chided Zelenskyy about saying \"thank you.\" Mr. Trump said it's \"good\" for the American people to see what's going on.\n\"You have to be thankful,\" Mr. Trump said. \"You don't have the cards. You're buried there, people are dying, you're running low on soldiers.\" Zelenskyy said Ukraine wants the war to end but must have security assurances along with any sort of ceasefire agreement.\u00a0 Amid the chaos, a reporter asked \u2014 what if Russia violates a ceasefire? \"What if anything?\" Mr. Trump responded. \"What if a bomb drops on your head right now? Okay?\"\u00a0 Earlier in their meeting, before it grew heated, Zelenskyy said negotiations can't only entail talk of a ceasefire, as Mr. Trump pushes for a ceasefire agreement without security assurances included.\u00a0 \"Just ceasefire will never work,\" Zelenskyy said, adding that \"25 times\" Putin \"broke his own signature,\" or violated his word on agreements.\u00a0 \"But he never broke to me,\" Mr. Trump said.\nA White House official said that the Ukrainians \"have been difficult to negotiate with [for] quite some time,\" and the Oval Office argument was \"the tipping point.\" The minerals deal would have been a \"first step to a lasting peace,\" but Zelenskyy \"overplayed his cards.\" The meeting went so poorly that after it ended, Mr. Trump continued to criticize Zelenskyy on social media, saying he is \"not ready for peace.\"\u00a0 \"We had a very meaningful meeting in the White House today,\" Mr. Trump wrote on Truth Social. \"Much was learned that could never be understood without conversation under such fire and pressure. It's amazing what comes out through emotion, and I have determined that President Zelenskyy is not ready for Peace if America is involved, because he feels our involvement gives him a big advantage in negotiations. I don't want advantage, I want PEACE. He disrespected the United States of America in its cherished Oval Office. He can come back when he is ready for Peace.\" \u00a0 Zelenskyy was spotted leaving the White House at 1:41 p.m. After his team was told to leave the White House, Zelenskyy posted on X : \"Thank you America, thank you for your support, thank you for this visit. Thank you\u00a0 @POTUS , Congress, and the American people. Ukraine needs just and lasting peace, and we are working exactly for that.\" Zelenskyy was scheduled to speak at the Hudson Institute in Washington Friday afternoon, but according to event organizers, Zelenskyy's office informed them he would not be coming.\u00a0 As Mr. Trump left for his Mar-a-Lago property in Florida on Friday afternoon, CBS News asked him what Zelensky needs to do in order for Mr. Trump to restart talks.\n\"He's gotta say, 'I wanna make peace,'\" Mr. Trump said. \"He doesn't have to stand there and say about, 'Putin this, Putin that.' All negative things. He's gotta say, 'I wanna make peace. I don't want to fight a war any longer.' His people are dying. He doesn't have the cards just so you understand it, okay?\" Administration sources on next steps High-level sources with the Trump administration told CBS News that Ukrainian officials reached out Friday afternoon to senior White House officials desperate to get the deal back on track. However, they were told that would not happen today. Mr. Trump was unwilling to talk to Zelenskyy further today, the sources said.\u00a0 When Rubio and Waltz went into the Roosevelt Room of the White House to ask Zelenskyy to leave, they made it clear that any further engagements Friday would be counterproductive, the sources said, adding that Waltz told Zelenskyy that he had made a tremendous mistake and a disservice to Ukraine and to the U.S. No phone calls between Mr. Trump and Putin have been scheduled, the sources added, while multiple European officials have called top Trump officials since Zelenskyy departed the White House asking how the minerals deal can be salvaged.\u00a0 Zelenskyy will meet British Prime Minister Keir Starmer on Saturday, Starmer's office said, ahead of a wider summit of European leaders in London on Sunday to discuss a peace plan for Ukraine, Reuters news agency reported. Regarding Zelenskyy's request for military guarantees, the U.S. made it clear Mr. Trump wanted an economic partnership, and then they would talk about the guarantees as part of the ceasefire if it happened, the sources said. There was no discussion among Trump officials about putting U.S. boots on the ground. The sources said that the White House is uncertain if it can help facilitate an end to the fighting. Mr. Trump is not seeking regime change in Ukraine, the sources said, and there have been no discussions about who in Ukraine might be a better leader than Zelenskyy.\nWhat to know about Zelenskyy's White House visit Mr. Trump mentioned earlier this week that the U.S. had reached a deal with Zelenskyy on a broad framework for sharing Ukraine's\u00a0 mineral resources , and that the Ukrainian leader was coming to the White House because he \"would like to sign it together with me.\" Negotiations over the minerals continued despite public tension between the two leaders in recent days. Mr. Trump appeared to blame Ukraine for the war Russia started and labeled Zelenskyy a \"dictator,\" while declining to say the same of Russian President Vladimir Putin.\u00a0 One Ukrainian official told CBS News Kyiv hopes the signing of the agreement would ensure the continued flow of security support that Ukraine needs. Mr. Trump said Thursday the deal would help pay back American taxpayers for supporting Ukraine over the past three years.\nPresident Trump greets Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy as he arrives at the White House on Feb. 28, 2025.\nGetty Images\nIn a post on X Wednesday, Zelenskyy wrote , \"Peace and security guarantees are the key to ensuring that Russia can no longer destroy the lives of other nations.\" He added, \"For me and for all of us in the world, it's important that U.S. support is not stopped. Strength is needed on the path to peace.\" Mr. Trump spoke with Putin earlier this month and said the Russian leader wants an end to the war. Last week, the president said he trusts Russia to negotiate in good faith, as top Trump administration officials met with Russian negotiators in Saudi Arabia without a Ukrainian representative. The president on Thursday said he believes Putin would comply with any peace agreement reached.\u00a0 \"I don't believe he's going to violate his word,\" Mr. Trump said.\u00a0 Mr. Trump last week called Zelenskyy a \"dictator,\" \u00a0referring to the fact that the Ukrainian leader's five-year term expired last year, and no new election has been held. Ukraine has been under martial law since soon after the war started in 2022, and the country's constitution bans elections during martial law. On Monday, during a meeting with French President Emmanuel Macron, Mr. Trump was asked whether he views Putin as a dictator, since he called Zelenskyy one.\u00a0 \"I don't use those words lightly, I think that we're going to see how it all works out,\" he replied. \"Let's see what happens.\"\nMr. Trump has even cast blame on Kyiv for being invaded by Russia. \"You should have never started it, you could have made a deal,\" Mr. Trump said of Ukraine last week.\u00a0 Top Trump administration officials have also been reluctant to criticize Putin. National security adviser Mike Waltz didn't answer directly when a reporter asked him if Mr. Trump views Putin as a dictator. He also sidestepped a question about who bears more responsibility for the war, Russia or Ukraine. Referring to Mr. Trump, Waltz replied, \"His goal here is to bring this war to an end, period.\" The president frequently says the war never would have started if he had been president, rather than Joe Biden. On the campaign trail, Mr. Trump vowed he would end the war between Russia and Ukraine before even taking office.\u00a0 \"Before I even arrive at the Oval Office, shortly after we win the presidency, I will have the horrible war between Russia and Ukraine settled,\" Mr. Trump said at a June rally. \"I will get it settled before I even become president.\" But after winning the election, Mr. Trump suggested that reaching peace between Russia and Ukraine might be more difficult than forging peace in the Middle East.\n\"I think actually more difficult is going to be the Russia-Ukraine situation,\" Mr. Trump said in December. \"I see that as more difficult.\" Earlier this week, Zelenskyy said he would give up the presidency if doing so would achieve lasting peace for Ukraine and membership in NATO.\u00a0 \"If to achieve peace, you really need me to give up my post, I'm ready,\" Zelenskyy said at a forum marking the three-year anniversary of Russia's full-scale invasion.\nWar in Ukraine\nMore\nMost European leaders back Zelenskyy as he joins crisis talks in London\nEuropean allies rally around Ukraine after Trump-Zelenskyy rift\nWatch video of Trump and Zelenskyy's meeting\nZelenskyy was told to leave the White House after blowup with Trump and Vance\nU.K. ready to put \"boots on the ground\" to support peace deal in Ukraine, Starmer says\nMore\nIn:\n JD Vance\nRare Earth Minerals\nUkraine\nDonald Trump\nRussia\nWhite House\nVolodymyr Zelenskyy\nKathryn Watson\nKathryn Watson is a politics reporter for CBS News Digital, based in Washington, D.C.\n\u00a9 2025 CBS Interactive Inc.

By Molly Nagle and Ivan Pereira March 1, 2025, 12:27 PM 4:33 President Donald Trump meets with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the White House in Washington, D.C., Feb. 28, 2025. Brian Snyder/Reuters While Friday's explosive meeting between President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy ended with a shouting match, the start of the Oval Office meeting was full of optimism about signing the minerals deal. Trump, who called the Ukrainian president a dictator last week, started the Oval Office spray in a smoother fashion, saying, \"We've actually known each other for a long time. We've been dealing with each other for a long time and very well there. We had a little negotiation spat, but that worked out great, I think, for both countries.\" Zelenskyy was also optimistic about an agreement that would have given the United States access to critical minerals from Ukraine.

Brian Snyder/Reuters MORE: Photos: Trump, Vance have tense blow up with Zelenskyy in Oval Office \"I hope that this document will be the first step to real security guarantees for Ukraine,\" he said. \"Our people, our children really count on it. And, of course, we count that America will not stop support. Really, for us, it's very important to support and to continue it. I want to discuss it with details further.\" Zelenskyy urged the U.S. to take a strong position in stopping Russian President Vladimir Putin, saying he is a \"killer\" and \"terrorist.\" \"I hope that together we can stop him. But for us, it's very important to to save our country, our values, our freedom and democracy,\" Zelenskyy said. Zelenskyy also stressed the importance of having the U.S. backing up European security contingencies. \"I think that France and U.K. already spoke to you, and we know that Europe is ready, but without the United States, they will not be ready to be as strong as we need,\" he said. Still, Trump argued that Russia will not go back on its word once a peace deal is reached, and he declined to get into security guarantees that Zelenskyy said he views as critical to any peace agreement.

I don't worry about security right now.\" Other cracks started to show just over 10 minutes into the spray, including one notable moment when Zelenskyy and Trump disagreed over the amount of support Europe has given Ukraine. \"They really gave a lot, Mr. President,\" Zelenskyy said. \"They gave a lot -- but they gave much less,\" Trump replied, without providing details.

I'm aligned with the United States of America. And for the good of the world,\" Trump said. Vice President J.D. Vance then chimed in and continued to push Trump's point, claiming President Joe Biden did not do enough to deter the war. At that point, Zelenskyy interjected, bringing up the struggles his country has faced over the last decade, prompting Vance and Trump to shout at the Ukrainian president.

Keith Kellogg secured the long-sought agreement with Ukraine that would have provided Washington with 50% of all future proceeds from the European country\u2019s lucrative critical and rare-earth minerals .\n\u201cKellogg and Zelensky had agreed to a deal with one item still to be finalized,\u201d the US official said of the talks that concluded Feb. 21.\nAs negotiations wrapped up, Zelensky chief of staff Andrii Yermak pushed for the Ukrainian president to join Trump at the White House to sign the agreement.\n3\nUS Special Presidential Envoy Keith Kellogg (R) advised Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to sign the mineral rights deal in Kyiv.

The president's closest advisers \u2014 stunned after the debacle in the Oval Office \u2014 huddled around the Cabinet Room's oblong table for lunch, sources familiar with the events told CBS News.\u00a0 Vice President JD Vance, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, National Security Adviser Mike Waltz, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, special envoy to Ukraine and Russia, retired Gen. Keith Kellogg, and White House chief of staff Susie Wiles were joined by Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina as the group rehashed what had just transpired.\u00a0 They shared disbelief over what one source characterized as Zelenskyy badgering the president. Another official said that, had Zelenskyy kept his disagreements behind closed doors, the blowup wouldn't have happened.\nDuring the contentious meeting, Mr. Trump and Vance took an aggressive and sometimes belittling tone with Zelenskyy after he expressed doubt over whether Russian President Vladimir Putin would honor a potential peace agreement given that he had repeatedly violated ceasefire deals, including the Minsk agreements , leading up to Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine. In the hours after Zelenskyy was asked to leave the White House at the behest of Rubio and Waltz \u2014 with a joint press conference scrapped \u2014 there was discussion about whether the Ukrainian leader should fire whoever may have advised him on Friday's strategy. CBS News has reached out to Ukrainian officials for comment.\u00a0 Some of the Trump team's frustration targeted Zelenskyy's chief adviser, Andriy Yermak, whom they believed had undermined negotiations in recent days. Others said they weren't so sure it was an adviser problem.\u00a0 It wasn't the first time Zelenskyy had clashed with his American counterpart. President Biden once hung up on Zelenskyy because of the Ukrainian president's perceived combativeness, sources familiar with the call told CBS News. The friction was kept private and officials insist the dispute was over policy \u2014 not basic facts like which country had started the war.\nIn recent days, there were signs the multibillion-dollar critical minerals deal might not come to fruition. Neither side had signed preliminary paperwork that typically precedes an economic agreement of this scale. On Friday morning, Graham, Republican Sen. Roger Wicker of Mississippi, Democratic Sen. Amy Klobochar of Minnesota, and others met privately with Zelenskyy at the Hay-Adams Hotel in Washington, D.C. They recommended that Zelenskyy avoid being contentious, say thank you and sign the deal without changes, according to people in the room.\u00a0 Some Trump advisers were nervous the deal might go south before the ceremonial signing, but felt confident by the time Mr. Trump greeted Zelenskyy. They viewed it as an economic security guarantee, a shared investment binding the U.S. and Ukraine for a generation, sources said.\u00a0 Zelenskyy had appealed to the West for ceasefire and post-war security guarantees, which were not explicitly included in the minerals deal. In Kyiv last month, Treasury Secretary Bessent had described the agreement as the foundation for a larger peace deal, and an economic partnership that would provide once the conflict is over a 'long term security shield for all Ukrainians.' However, the deal itself was not a ceasefire or peace agreement. Bessent described it as a very strong signal to Russian leadership of American commitment. Kyiv had hoped for security guarantees up front that would secure a pledge by the U.S. to help keep the long term peace and prevent Russia from invading again. The White House expected to finalize a version of the deal Friday that was essentially the same as one Bessent presented to Kyiv in mid-February. One modification: a provision was removed that would have placed a $500 billion cap on the value of minerals Ukraine would provide. The change was made at Ukraine's request because Zelenskyy disliked the narrative that Ukraine owed a certain repayment for past aid, people familiar with the deal said.\u00a0 \"We were trying to make it reasonable for them,\" one Trump adviser said. Trump's team privately discussed how they liked the new version better because it meant a deal could be worth more than initially conceived.\nThe minerals deal was a concept Graham had circulated as an avenue to create a new, mutually beneficial relationship for the two countries. Zelenskyy had presented it to Mr. Trump, at Graham's urging, at a meeting at Trump Tower in September. But on Friday, staff quietly removed the formal ceremonial set-up from the East Room \u2014 a conference table and two podiums, and two sets of binders with unsigned documents.\u00a0 Zelenskyy on Saturday arrived in London to meet with sympathetic European allies. No plans had been made for Mr. Trump and Zelenskyy to speak again.\u00a0 In the meantime, America remains the most significant military and financial backer of Ukraine in its war against Russian aggression. There is $3.85 billion in military equipment already designated for delivery to Ukraine, and it is not clear if Mr. Trump will still clear it for delivery.\u00a0 \"They are fortunate it's not off already,\" a senior U.S. official told CBS News.\u00a0 As for any further pledges of U.S. support from the Republican-led Congress, House Speaker Mike Johnson recently said there's no appetite for it.\nMore from CBS News\nRep.

While the Ukrainians were waiting in the other room, national security adviser Mike Waltz and Secretary of State Marco Rubio told them to leave. The official said Zelenskyy was trying to smooth things over and asked for a reset, but Mr. Trump and other administration officials were offended by Zelenskyy's behavior.\u00a0 The contentious meeting exposed severe rifts between the U.S. and Ukraine, upending the planned signing of a rare minerals deal between the two countries as Mr. Trump pressures Ukraine to agree to end the war that Russia began. During the course of the meeting, Mr. Trump threatened Zelenskyy to make a deal with Russia or \"we're out,\" and Vance accused the Ukrainian leader of being \"disrespectful.\" Later in the day, high level administration sources confirmed to CBS that there have been discussions about whether U.S. will keep sending military aid to Ukraine after the Oval Office clash between Mr. Trump and Zelenskyy. \"They are fortunate it is not off already,\" a senior U.S. official said to CBS News on the status of U.S. aid to Ukraine.\nThe meeting veered into tense exchanges after Vance said during the course of the meeting that the world has reached this point in part because of the Biden administration's actions, and said it was time for diplomacy.\u00a0 Zelenskyy challenged Vance on this point, noting there had been other ceasefire agreements Russian President Vladimir Putin had broken \u2014 and not just during the Obama administration. During Mr. Trump's administration\u00a0 Putin violated \u00a0the Minsk ceasefire agreements, which\u00a0 had been signed \u00a0by both Russia and Ukraine. And Zelenskyy pointed out that he had signed an agreement with Putin over the exchange of prisoners, \"but he didn't do it.\" \"What kind of diplomacy, JD, you are speaking about,\" Zelenskyy asked Vance. Vance retorted that it was \"disrespectful\" for Zelenskyy to try to \"litigate\" his case in front of the American media.\n\"You should be thanking the president for trying to bring an end to this conflict,\" Vance told Zelenskyy.\nHeated Trump-Zelenskyy meeting in Oval Office | Special Report\n21:01\nZelenskyy asked Vance if he'd ever been to Ukraine.\u00a0 Vance said he's watched videos of what's happened in Ukraine, accusing Zelenskyy of bringing people on a \"propaganda tour\" when they visit Ukraine.\u00a0 \"Do you think that it's respectful to come to the Oval Office of the United States of America and attack the administration that is trying to prevent the destruction of your country?\" Vance asked.\u00a0 Zelenskyy, noting that for now, the U.S. is separated from the fighting by an ocean, said of the war, \"You don't feel it now, but you'll feel it in the future.\"\u00a0 \"You don't know that,\" Mr. Trump argued. \"You don't know that. Don't tell us what we're going to feel. We're trying to solve a problem. Don't tell us what we're gonna feel, because you're in no position to dictate that. You're in no position to dictate what we're going to feel. We're going to feel very good.\"\u00a0 \"You don't have the cards right now,\" Mr. Trump said, as Zelenskyy continued to interject and disagree. \"With us, you start having cards. Right now, you don't have your playing cards, your playing cards \u2014 you're gambling with the lives of millions of people. \"You're gambling with World War III. You're gambling with World War III.\"\n\"Have you said 'thank you' once, this entire meeting? No, in this entire meeting, have you said 'thank you,'\" Vance said.\u00a0 Zelenskyy kept a measured tone throughout the entire exchange, even as Mr. Trump and Vance at times raised their voices.\u00a0 \"Please,\" Zelenskyy said. \"You think that if you will speak very loudly about the war\u2014\" Mr. Trump cut off Zelenskyy and said his country is in \"big trouble\" but \"you have a damn good chance of coming out okay because of us.\"\u00a0 Zelenskyy said his country has stayed strong from the beginning of the war, and Ukrainians are thankful.\u00a0 \"It's going to be a very hard thing to do business like this,\" Mr. Trump said, as Vance again chided Zelenskyy about saying \"thank you.\" Mr. Trump said it's \"good\" for the American people to see what's going on.\n\"You have to be thankful,\" Mr. Trump said. \"You don't have the cards. You're buried there, people are dying, you're running low on soldiers.\" Zelenskyy said Ukraine wants the war to end but must have security assurances along with any sort of ceasefire agreement.\u00a0 Amid the chaos, a reporter asked \u2014 what if Russia violates a ceasefire? \"What if anything?\" Mr. Trump responded. \"What if a bomb drops on your head right now? Okay?\"\u00a0 Earlier in their meeting, before it grew heated, Zelenskyy said negotiations can't only entail talk of a ceasefire, as Mr. Trump pushes for a ceasefire agreement without security assurances included.\u00a0 \"Just ceasefire will never work,\" Zelenskyy said, adding that \"25 times\" Putin \"broke his own signature,\" or violated his word on agreements.\u00a0 \"But he never broke to me,\" Mr. Trump said.\nA White House official said that the Ukrainians \"have been difficult to negotiate with [for] quite some time,\" and the Oval Office argument was \"the tipping point.\" The minerals deal would have been a \"first step to a lasting peace,\" but Zelenskyy \"overplayed his cards.\" The meeting went so poorly that after it ended, Mr. Trump continued to criticize Zelenskyy on social media, saying he is \"not ready for peace.\"\u00a0 \"We had a very meaningful meeting in the White House today,\" Mr. Trump wrote on Truth Social. \"Much was learned that could never be understood without conversation under such fire and pressure. It's amazing what comes out through emotion, and I have determined that President Zelenskyy is not ready for Peace if America is involved, because he feels our involvement gives him a big advantage in negotiations. I don't want advantage, I want PEACE. He disrespected the United States of America in its cherished Oval Office. He can come back when he is ready for Peace.\" \u00a0 Zelenskyy was spotted leaving the White House at 1:41 p.m. After his team was told to leave the White House, Zelenskyy posted on X : \"Thank you America, thank you for your support, thank you for this visit. Thank you\u00a0 @POTUS , Congress, and the American people. Ukraine needs just and lasting peace, and we are working exactly for that.\" Zelenskyy was scheduled to speak at the Hudson Institute in Washington Friday afternoon, but according to event organizers, Zelenskyy's office informed them he would not be coming.\u00a0 As Mr. Trump left for his Mar-a-Lago property in Florida on Friday afternoon, CBS News asked him what Zelensky needs to do in order for Mr. Trump to restart talks.\n\"He's gotta say, 'I wanna make peace,'\" Mr. Trump said. \"He doesn't have to stand there and say about, 'Putin this, Putin that.' All negative things. He's gotta say, 'I wanna make peace. I don't want to fight a war any longer.' His people are dying. He doesn't have the cards just so you understand it, okay?\" Administration sources on next steps High-level sources with the Trump administration told CBS News that Ukrainian officials reached out Friday afternoon to senior White House officials desperate to get the deal back on track. However, they were told that would not happen today. Mr. Trump was unwilling to talk to Zelenskyy further today, the sources said.\u00a0 When Rubio and Waltz went into the Roosevelt Room of the White House to ask Zelenskyy to leave, they made it clear that any further engagements Friday would be counterproductive, the sources said, adding that Waltz told Zelenskyy that he had made a tremendous mistake and a disservice to Ukraine and to the U.S. No phone calls between Mr. Trump and Putin have been scheduled, the sources added, while multiple European officials have called top Trump officials since Zelenskyy departed the White House asking how the minerals deal can be salvaged.\u00a0 Zelenskyy will meet British Prime Minister Keir Starmer on Saturday, Starmer's office said, ahead of a wider summit of European leaders in London on Sunday to discuss a peace plan for Ukraine, Reuters news agency reported. Regarding Zelenskyy's request for military guarantees, the U.S. made it clear Mr. Trump wanted an economic partnership, and then they would talk about the guarantees as part of the ceasefire if it happened, the sources said. There was no discussion among Trump officials about putting U.S. boots on the ground. The sources said that the White House is uncertain if it can help facilitate an end to the fighting. Mr. Trump is not seeking regime change in Ukraine, the sources said, and there have been no discussions about who in Ukraine might be a better leader than Zelenskyy.\nWhat to know about Zelenskyy's White House visit Mr. Trump mentioned earlier this week that the U.S. had reached a deal with Zelenskyy on a broad framework for sharing Ukraine's\u00a0 mineral resources , and that the Ukrainian leader was coming to the White House because he \"would like to sign it together with me.\" Negotiations over the minerals continued despite public tension between the two leaders in recent days. Mr. Trump appeared to blame Ukraine for the war Russia started and labeled Zelenskyy a \"dictator,\" while declining to say the same of Russian President Vladimir Putin.\u00a0 One Ukrainian official told CBS News Kyiv hopes the signing of the agreement would ensure the continued flow of security support that Ukraine needs. Mr. Trump said Thursday the deal would help pay back American taxpayers for supporting Ukraine over the past three years.\nPresident Trump greets Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy as he arrives at the White House on Feb. 28, 2025.\nGetty Images\nIn a post on X Wednesday, Zelenskyy wrote , \"Peace and security guarantees are the key to ensuring that Russia can no longer destroy the lives of other nations.\" He added, \"For me and for all of us in the world, it's important that U.S. support is not stopped. Strength is needed on the path to peace.\" Mr. Trump spoke with Putin earlier this month and said the Russian leader wants an end to the war. Last week, the president said he trusts Russia to negotiate in good faith, as top Trump administration officials met with Russian negotiators in Saudi Arabia without a Ukrainian representative. The president on Thursday said he believes Putin would comply with any peace agreement reached.\u00a0 \"I don't believe he's going to violate his word,\" Mr. Trump said.\u00a0 Mr. Trump last week called Zelenskyy a \"dictator,\" \u00a0referring to the fact that the Ukrainian leader's five-year term expired last year, and no new election has been held. Ukraine has been under martial law since soon after the war started in 2022, and the country's constitution bans elections during martial law. On Monday, during a meeting with French President Emmanuel Macron, Mr. Trump was asked whether he views Putin as a dictator, since he called Zelenskyy one.\u00a0 \"I don't use those words lightly, I think that we're going to see how it all works out,\" he replied. \"Let's see what happens.\"\nMr. Trump has even cast blame on Kyiv for being invaded by Russia. \"You should have never started it, you could have made a deal,\" Mr. Trump said of Ukraine last week.\u00a0 Top Trump administration officials have also been reluctant to criticize Putin. National security adviser Mike Waltz didn't answer directly when a reporter asked him if Mr. Trump views Putin as a dictator. He also sidestepped a question about who bears more responsibility for the war, Russia or Ukraine. Referring to Mr. Trump, Waltz replied, \"His goal here is to bring this war to an end, period.\" The president frequently says the war never would have started if he had been president, rather than Joe Biden. On the campaign trail, Mr. Trump vowed he would end the war between Russia and Ukraine before even taking office.\u00a0 \"Before I even arrive at the Oval Office, shortly after we win the presidency, I will have the horrible war between Russia and Ukraine settled,\" Mr. Trump said at a June rally. \"I will get it settled before I even become president.\" But after winning the election, Mr. Trump suggested that reaching peace between Russia and Ukraine might be more difficult than forging peace in the Middle East.\n\"I think actually more difficult is going to be the Russia-Ukraine situation,\" Mr. Trump said in December. \"I see that as more difficult.\" Earlier this week, Zelenskyy said he would give up the presidency if doing so would achieve lasting peace for Ukraine and membership in NATO.\u00a0 \"If to achieve peace, you really need me to give up my post, I'm ready,\" Zelenskyy said at a forum marking the three-year anniversary of Russia's full-scale invasion.\nWar in Ukraine\nMore\nMost European leaders back Zelenskyy as he joins crisis talks in London\nEuropean allies rally around Ukraine after Trump-Zelenskyy rift\nWatch video of Trump and Zelenskyy's meeting\nZelenskyy was told to leave the White House after blowup with Trump and Vance\nU.K. ready to put \"boots on the ground\" to support peace deal in Ukraine, Starmer says\nMore\nIn:\n JD Vance\nRare Earth Minerals\nUkraine\nDonald Trump\nRussia\nWhite House\nVolodymyr Zelenskyy\nKathryn Watson\nKathryn Watson is a politics reporter for CBS News Digital, based in Washington, D.C.\n\u00a9 2025 CBS Interactive Inc.

Here are some notable comments from top Democratic lawmakers: Senator Chuck Schumer, Democrats' leader in the chamber , on X: \"Trump and Vance are doing Putin\u2019s dirty work.\n\nSenate Democrats will never stop fighting for freedom and democracy.\" Representative Hakeem Jefffies, the highest-ranking Democrat in the House: \"Today\u2019s White House meeting with the President of Ukraine was appalling and will only serve to further embolden Vladimir Putin, a brutal dictator. The United States must not reward Russian aggression and continue to appease Putin.\" Senator Jeanne Shaheen, the most senior Democrat on the Foreign Relations Committee, to a reporter: \"It's distressing to see the President... is walking away from our commitment in Ukraine, and doesn't seem to understand what a murderous dictator Vladimir Putin is.\" Representative Gregory Meeks, the most senior Democrat on the House Foreign Affairs Committee: \"Trump\u2019s actions today undermined U.S. leadership, emboldened our adversaries, humiliated both himself and his Republican Party, and insulted the generations of Americans who fought and died to build America\u2019s standing in the world. It is not President Zelensky who disrespected the United States in the Oval Office. It was Donald Trump.\u201d Senator Tammy Duckworth, a combat veteran : \"Attacking our democratic partner in service of an autocratic dictator.\nTrump is a national disgrace.\" Representative Ted Lieu, a long-serving member of the House who sits on the Foreign Affairs Committee: \"Nobody is celebrating President Trump and Vice President Vance\u2019s embarrassing behavior in the Oval Office more than Vladimir Putin. Today was a distressing moment for those of us who value democracy and America\u2019s role as a force for good.\" Senator Chris Murphy, a more liberal Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee who has emerged as one of Trump's fiercest critics, on X: \"What just happened in the Oval Office was a planned ambush, designed to help a brutal Russian dictator and hurt America's security.\nTrump has become Putin's lapdog, and America's global power is hemorrhaging as America sides with dictators over democracy.

The wardrobe question presaged the argument about thankfulness and respect. \"Why don't\nyou wear a suit? Do you own a suit? A lot of Americans have a problem with you\nnot respecting the dignity of the office,\" the reporter asked. Zelensky has made a habit of wearing sweatshirts, usually\nadorned with the Ukrainian trident symbol, even when at important meetings with\nworld leaders. He seemed unperturbed by the question. \"I will wear (a) costume after this war will finish,\u201d\nhe told the reporter. \u201cMaybe something like yours, maybe something better\u2026\nMaybe something cheaper.\" The question was posed by Brian Glenn, the Chief White House\nCorrespondent for Real America\u2019s Voice, a right-wing network with a show line-up\nchock-full of Trump allies. It\u2019s unclear how salty the Ukrainian president meant to be in\nhis answer - the word \u201csuit\u201d can be translated into Ukrainian as \u201ckostyum\u201d - and\nthe news conference swiftly moved on. But the issue of due respect was at the centre of the full-fledged\nargument that burst out in the Oval Office just minutes later.

Wire\nUSA TODAY Show Caption\nHide Caption\nTrump says Zelenskyy is 'not ready for peace' after Oval clash President Donald Trump said President Zelenskyy is not ready for peace if America is involved.\" Zelenskyy says otherwise. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Friday evening that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy should apologize for a heated exchange in the Oval Office that scuttled plans for an economic partnership between the two countries. Zelenskyy declined that evening in an interview with Fox News' Bret Baier to apologize to President Donald Trump . \"There was no need for him to go in there and become antagonistic,\" Rubio told CNN's Kaitlan Collins\u00a0in an interview. \"I think he should apologize for wasting our time for a meeting that was gonna end the way it did.\" Zelenskyy was in Washington to sign an\u00a0 \u201ceconomic partnership\u201d deal \u00a0which would have given the U.S. access to critical minerals in Ukraine. Trump has long said he wanted the deal in exchange for American military support. The Ukrainian delegation was asked to leave the White House after the argument. Testy exchange Zelenskyy began the meeting by reasserting his desire for security guarantees from the U.S. to ensure Russia doesn't restart the conflict after a peace deal. He made clear he won't compromise with Russian President Vladimir Putin, who he called \"a killer and terrorist.\" The\u00a0 testy exchange \u00a0before reporters began about 40 minutes into the 50 minute meeting with Vice President\u00a0 JD Vance \u00a0praising Trump for negotiating directly with Russia to end the war that began with\u00a0 Russia's 2022 invasion and occupation \u00a0of Ukraine.\u00a0Ukraine and other European countries were not invited to be part of the negotiations. Zelenskyy argued \u00a0that Russia's prior actions have shown it to be an untrustworthy diplomatic partner, to which\u00a0 Vance responded that the Ukrainian president \u00a0was\u00a0 being \"disrespectful\" \u00a0to Trump. Rubio said that Zelenskyy should not have insisted on traveling to Washington to sign the agreement in person and that arguing in public with Trump and Vance that diplomacy would not work with Russia harms Trump's ability to get Russia to the negotiating table. Rubio said Zelenskyy was trying to get Trump into a position of having to attack Putin. \"Don't come here and create a scenario where you are going to start lecturing us about how diplomacy isn't going to work,\" Rubio said.\nFacebook\nTwitter\nEmail Share your feedback to help improve our site!

A tense Oval Office meeting Friday that was supposed to end in Ukraine agreeing to share mining resources with the U.S. devolved into a heated argument as President Donald Trump and Vice President J.D. Vance insisted Ukraine should express more gratitude for U.S. support and agree to a ceasefire with Russia, even without clear security guarantees from the U.S. \u201cYou don\u2019t have the cards right now,\u201d Trump told Zelensky, as the two interrupted each other during a forceful exchange in front of TV cameras.\u00a0 \u201cWe\u2019re not playing cards,\u201d Zelensky shot back. Ukraine's leader repeatedly interrupted Trump and insisted that Russian President Vladimir Putin couldn\u2019t be trusted, noting he had already broken ceasefire and prisoner exchange agreements. Trump bristled at Zelensky pushing back and his voice became sharper. \u201cYou\u2019re gambling with the lives of millions of people. You\u2019re gambling with World War III,\u201d Trump said. Shortly afterwards, Trump canceled a planned press conference with Zelensky and cut off negotiations, writing on Truth Social that Zelensky had \u201cdisrespected the United States of America in its cherished Oval Office. He can come back when he is ready for Peace.\u201d It was a scene unlike any before seen by the public in the Oval Office. Usually in such appearances, two world leaders smile for the cameras and shake hands for the press. The tough negotiations typically happen away from the cameras. But the simmering tensions between the two leaders boiled over in full view, with clips of the meeting immediately gaining attention around the world. The two leaders had been poised to sign an historic agreement on Friday to set up a joint investment fund for rebuilding Ukraine that would have allowed the U.S. to profit off mining rare earth minerals in the war-torn country. Ukraine was prepared to put 50% of future revenues from the country\u2019s oil, gas and minerals into the fund. That deal now appears dead. Zelensky was told to leave the White House early, and a planned press conference with the two leaders was cancelled. It\u2019s a major setback for Ukraine. The investment deal was brokered by Senator Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican, and others as a way to keep Trump interested in backing Ukraine\u2019s security while brokering a peace negotiation between Putin and Zelensky. Trump has expressed frustration with how much the U.S. is spending on military assistance to Ukraine and has said he wants European countries to spend more on security assistance to Ukraine. In three years, the U.S. Congress has allocated more than $175 billion in security and development assistance to Kyiv, according to the Congressional Research Service . In his post on TruthSocial, Trump rebuked Zelensky for operating as if \u201cour involvement gives him a big advantage in negotiations,\u201d Trump wrote. \u201cI don\u2019t want advantage, I want PEACE.\u201d After the meeting, Zelensky tried to repair the damage. \u201cThank you America, thank you for your support, thank you for this visit. Thank you @POTUS, Congress, and the American people. Ukraine needs just and lasting peace, and we are working exactly for that,\u201d Zelensky wrote on X. But even Zelensky\u2019s Republican allies like Graham thought that the meeting with Trump may have done more damage than can be repaired. Graham told reporters at the White House that he had counseled Zelensky earlier in the day to stay positive and not to \u201ctake the bait\u201d during the meeting with Trump and that security guarantees could be worked out later. Graham said that the meeting was \u201ca complete and utter disaster\u201d and Zelensky either needs to resign \u201cor he needs to change.\u201d The long Oval Office appearance grew heated when Zelensky repeatedly insisted that Putin could not be trusted and a ceasefire agreement wasn\u2019t sufficient without security guarantees from the U.S. Vance, sitting on a couch next to Trump, interjected, saying that the Biden administration had \u201ctalked tough\u201d about Putin and that didn\u2019t prevent Putin from taking more of Ukraine. Vance said it was \"disrespectful\" for Zelensky to sit in the Oval Office and \u201ctry to litigate this in front of the American media.\u201d He said that Ukraine has \u201cmanpower problems\u201d in the war and should be thanking Trump for working to bring an end to the fighting. But Zelensky wasn\u2019t backing down. He described how Ukraine had negotiated ceasefire and prisoner swap agreements with Putin in the past, but Putin didn\u2019t uphold his end of the bargain. \u201cWhat kind of diplomacy, J.D., you are speaking about?\u201d Zelensky said, breaking with typical decorum and using the vice president\u2019s initials. The Ukrainian president told Vance he should visit Ukraine. \u201cCome once,\u201d he said. Zelenksy told Vance that if Putin is allowed to continue his aggression in Ukraine, the U.S. would eventually feel threatened from Russia. \u201cYou have a nice ocean. You don\u2019t feel now. But you will feel it in the future,\u201d Zelensky said.\u00a0 That\u2019s when Trump jumped in. \u201cDon\u2019t tell us what we\u2019re gonna feel,\u201d Trump said. Trump said he had let the exchange continue in front of the press so that the public could see where the disagreement is between the leaders. \u201cI think it\u2019s good for the American people to see what\u2019s going on. I think it\u2019s very important. That\u2019s why I kept this going so long. You have to be thankful. You don\u2019t have the cards. You\u2019re buried there. Your people are dying. You\u2019re running low on soldiers. It would be a damn good decision \u2014 then you tell us, I don\u2019t want a ceasefire,\u201d Trump said. Soon after the striking Oval Office meeting, a host of European leaders took to social media to express their support for Ukraine. \"Dear Ukrainian friends, you are not alone,\" wrote Polish Prime Minister David Tusk on X. \"Ukraine, Spain stands with you,\" Spanish Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez declared . \"Ukraine is not alone\" added Annalena Baerbock, Germany's foreign minister. \"Germany together with our European allies stands united alongside #Ukraine - and against the Russian aggression. Ukraine can build on unwavering support from Germany, Europe and beyond. \"Sweden stands with Ukraine. You are not only fighting for your freedom but also for all of Europe\u2019s. Slava Ukraini!\" wrote Ulf Kristersson, the Swedish Prime Minister. Zelensky responded to many of the posts with \"Thank you for your support.\" Zelensky had been due to participate in an onstage discussion later in the day with the Hudson Institute. Soon after he left the White House, the event was cancelled. Zelensky did keep his planned interview with Fox News\u2019 Bret Baier on Friday evening. Asked if he would apologize to Trump for what he said in the Oval Office, Zelensky initially dodged the question, saying he was grateful to Trump and to the American people for the support given to Ukraine since Putin launched a full scale invasion in 2022. When Baier pressed him on whether he owed Trump an apology, Zelensky said \u201cno\u201d. He respects Trump and the American people, he said. \"I think that we have to be very open and very honest, and I\u2019m not sure that we did something bad,\" Zelensky said. James Goldgeier, a professor of international relations at American University, says the meeting with Trump was \u201cdefinitely a setback\u201d for Zelensky. The testy exchange exposed that Trump \u201chas zero interest in Ukraine, and he\u2019s annoyed that President Zelensky\u2019s desire to continue to save his country is getting in the way of some Trump deal.\u201d When Zelensky continued to push back against Trump\u2019s eagerness to work with Putin during the Oval Office argument, Trump launched into his long-standing anger at being investigated during his first term over Russia\u2019s efforts to help his 2016 campaign. He said efforts by Democratic administrations to stop Putin in Ukraine failed because Putin didn\u2019t respect Presidents Barack Obama or Joe Biden. \u201cThey respect me. Let me tell you. Putin went through a hell of a lot with me. He went through a phony witch hunt,\u201d Trump said. That tirade showed that Trump is \u201cfilled with this sense of anger and grievance,\u201d Goldgeier says. \u201cI don\u2019t believe he\u2019s standing up for America\u2019s interest in this situation\u2014he\u2019s just catering to Putin and sees Ukraine as an annoyance and he just let it all out.\u201d\u00a0 Daniel Fried, a former U.S. Ambassador to Poland, says Vance seemed like he wanted to pick a fight with Zelensky, and the squabble laid bare a conflict among Trump\u2019s own advisers. \u201cThe real fight was not Trump and Vance against Zelensky, but a fight within the administration, between those who would like to see a Trump peace plan work and him get the credit, but have Ukraine survive as an independent country, even if without some territory for the time being\u2014and others who want to simply forgo that option and weaken Ukraine and do some deal with Putin.\u201d Read more : Trump Administration Reversed Course More Than A Dozen Times in First Weeks At the end of his Friday evening Fox News interview, Zelensky was asked if he thought his relationship with Trump could be \u201csalvaged.\u201c After asking an interpreter to translate the word, Zelensky said \u201cYes, of course because it\u2019s relations more than two presidents.\u201d There are \u201cstrong relations\u201d between our two people, he said, and it is the American people who have helped \u201cto save\u201d Ukrainians. \u201cWe are thankful. Sorry for this. We wanted very much to have strong relations, and I am very confident we will have it,\u201d he said.

He says he does, but maybe he doesn\u2019t,\u201d Rubio added.\nRubio\u2019s remarks underlined the serious damage that has been done to the US-Ukrainian relationship at the end of a week that also saw the leaders of the UK and France visit Washington to make the case to Trump that the US needs to mediate an end to the war that doesn\u2019t prioritize Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s interests over Zelensky\u2019s.\nPresident Donald Trump talks with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy at the White House on Friday.\nBrian Snyder/Reuters\nRelated article\nZelensky bristled at his berating by Trump and Vance. After three years of war, what did they expect?\nAmerica\u2019s top diplomat spoke to CNN hours after attending the meeting, which ultimately ended absent a deal that would leverage Ukraine\u2019s rare-earth minerals or bring Russia\u2019s three-year war any closer to an end.\nIt instead saw Trump and Vance castigating the Ukrainian leader for what they saw as insufficient gratitude for the support the US has already provided for Ukraine and accusing him of over-playing his ability to negotiate.\nFollowing the meeting, Trump ordered Zelensky to leave the White House despite a desire from Ukraine to continue the talks, scrapped a scheduled joint press conference and plunged the future of US assistance to the Ukraine war effort, along with Zelensky\u2019s own future as a leader, into serious doubt.\nAsked about comments by South Carolina Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham \u2013 typically a strong supporter of Ukraine \u2013 after the meeting that Zelensky should consider resigning, Rubio responded that Trump has \u201ctaken no position on that.\u201d\n\u201cWhat he said today is, \u2018Let him come back when he ready to do peace.\u2019 That\u2019s what he said,\u201d Rubio said. The secretary added that Trump\u2019s position on Putin remains to \u201ctrust, but verify.\u201d\nOn Friday evening, Trump said he wants \u201canybody that\u2019s going to make peace\u201d to lead Ukraine, and added that Zelensky \u201cmay or may not be\u201d capable of achieving it.\nRubio also took issue with Zelensky\u2019s tone toward Vance during the meeting.\nAfter the vice president said the path toward peace and prosperity \u201cis, maybe, engaging in diplomacy,\u201d Zelensky responded by rattling off a series of diplomatic engagements Putin participated in before his 2022 full-scale invasion of Ukraine.\n\u201cWhat kind of diplomacy, JD, you are speaking about?\u201d Zelensky asked. Vance in turn called Ukraine\u2019s leader \u201cdisrespectful\u201d for trying \u201cto litigate this in front of the American media.\u201d\nRubio said the meeting went \u201coff the rails\u201d after that interaction.\n\u201cThat active, open undermining of efforts to bring about peace is deeply frustrating for everyone who\u2019s been involved in communications with them leading up to today, and I think he should apologize for wasting our time for a meeting that was going to end the way it did,\u201d the secretary said.\nRubio said Zelensky is welcome back to the White House when he is \u201cready to make peace and he\u2019s serious about peace.\u201d\n\u201cHow are you going to get Vladimir Putin and the Russian Federation to a table to discuss even the opportunity, whether even to explore whether there\u2019s an opportunity for peace?\u201d Rubio said. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to do it by calling them names.\u201d\nRubio said it was premature to think about whether Trump, Putin and Zelensky would eventually all meet for peace talks: \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of work to be done before we get to this point. This is a complex war that has causes behind it that go back a number of years, it is a lot to navigate. A lot has been invested on both sides.\u201d\n\u201cTonight, people will die in Ukraine,\u201d Rubio said. \u201cTonight, people will die in this conflict. We\u2019re trying to bring an end to this conflict, which is unsustainable. It\u2019s an unsustainable, bloody war that has to come to an end. And right now, the only leader in the world that can even have a chance of bringing about an end to this is named President Donald Trump, and we need to give him the opportunity to try and do that.\u201d\nThis story has been updated with additional details.\nAd Feedback\nAd Feedback\nAd Feedback\nAd Feedback\nAd Feedback\nAd Feedback\nAd Feedback\nAd Feedback\nSubscribe\nSign in\nMy Account\nSettings\nNewsletters\nTopics You Follow\nSign Out\nYour CNN account\nSign in to your CNN account\nLive TV\nListen\nWatch\nWorld\nAfrica\nAmericas\nAsia\nAustralia\nChina\nEurope\nIndia\nMiddle East\nUnited Kingdom\nUS Politics\nSCOTUS\nCongress\nFacts First\n2024 Elections\nBusiness\nTech\nMedia\nCalculators\nVideos\nMarkets\nPre-markets\nAfter-Hours\nFear & Greed\nInvesting\nMarkets Now\nNightcap\nHealth\nLife, But Better\nFitness\nFood\nSleep\nMindfulness\nRelationships\nEntertainment\nMovies\nTelevision\nCelebrity\nTech\nInnovate\nForeseeable Future\nMission: Ahead\nWork Transformed\nInnovative Cities\nStyle\nArts\nDesign\nFashion\nArchitecture\nLuxury\nBeauty\nVideo\nTravel\nDestinations\nFood & Drink\nStay\nNews\nVideos\nSports\nFootball\nTennis\nGolf\nMotorsport\nUS Sports\nOlympics\nClimbing\nEsports\nHockey\nScience\nSpace\nLife\nUnearthed\nClimate\nSolutions\nWeather\nWeather\nVideo\nClimate\nUkraine-Russia War\nIsrael-Hamas War\nFeatures\nAs Equals\nCall to Earth\nFreedom Project\nImpact Your World\nInside Africa\nCNN Heroes\nWatch\nLive TV\nCNN Fast\nShows A-Z\nCNN10\nCNN Max\nCNN TV Schedules\nListen\nCNN 5 Things\nChasing Life with Dr. Sanjay Gupta\nThe Assignment with Audie Cornish\nOne Thing\nTug of War\nCNN Political Briefing\nThe Axe Files\nAll There Is with Anderson Cooper\nAll CNN Audio podcasts\nGames\nCNN Crossword\nJumble Crossword\nPhoto Shuffle\nSudoblock\nSudoku\n5 Things Quiz\nAbout CNN\nPhotos\nInvestigations\nCNN Profiles\nCNN Leadership\nCNN Newsletters\nWork for CNN\nPolitics\nWatch\nListen\nLive TV\nFollow CNN Politics\nSubscribe\nSign in\nMy Account\nSettings\nNewsletters\nTopics You Follow\nSign Out\nYour CNN account\nSign in to your CNN account\nTerms of Use\nPrivacy Policy\nAd Choices\nAccessibility & CC\nAbout\nNewsletters\nTranscripts\n\u00a9 2025 Cable News Network.

While the Ukrainians were waiting in the other room, national security adviser Mike Waltz and Secretary of State Marco Rubio told them to leave. The official said Zelenskyy was trying to smooth things over and asked for a reset, but Mr. Trump and other administration officials were offended by Zelenskyy's behavior.\u00a0 The contentious meeting exposed severe rifts between the U.S. and Ukraine, upending the planned signing of a rare minerals deal between the two countries as Mr. Trump pressures Ukraine to agree to end the war that Russia began. During the course of the meeting, Mr. Trump threatened Zelenskyy to make a deal with Russia or \"we're out,\" and Vance accused the Ukrainian leader of being \"disrespectful.\" Later in the day, high level administration sources confirmed to CBS that there have been discussions about whether U.S. will keep sending military aid to Ukraine after the Oval Office clash between Mr. Trump and Zelenskyy. \"They are fortunate it is not off already,\" a senior U.S. official said to CBS News on the status of U.S. aid to Ukraine.\nThe meeting veered into tense exchanges after Vance said during the course of the meeting that the world has reached this point in part because of the Biden administration's actions, and said it was time for diplomacy.\u00a0 Zelenskyy challenged Vance on this point, noting there had been other ceasefire agreements Russian President Vladimir Putin had broken \u2014 and not just during the Obama administration. During Mr. Trump's administration\u00a0 Putin violated \u00a0the Minsk ceasefire agreements, which\u00a0 had been signed \u00a0by both Russia and Ukraine. And Zelenskyy pointed out that he had signed an agreement with Putin over the exchange of prisoners, \"but he didn't do it.\" \"What kind of diplomacy, JD, you are speaking about,\" Zelenskyy asked Vance. Vance retorted that it was \"disrespectful\" for Zelenskyy to try to \"litigate\" his case in front of the American media.\n\"You should be thanking the president for trying to bring an end to this conflict,\" Vance told Zelenskyy.\nHeated Trump-Zelenskyy meeting in Oval Office | Special Report\n21:01\nZelenskyy asked Vance if he'd ever been to Ukraine.\u00a0 Vance said he's watched videos of what's happened in Ukraine, accusing Zelenskyy of bringing people on a \"propaganda tour\" when they visit Ukraine.\u00a0 \"Do you think that it's respectful to come to the Oval Office of the United States of America and attack the administration that is trying to prevent the destruction of your country?\" Vance asked.\u00a0 Zelenskyy, noting that for now, the U.S. is separated from the fighting by an ocean, said of the war, \"You don't feel it now, but you'll feel it in the future.\"\u00a0 \"You don't know that,\" Mr. Trump argued. \"You don't know that. Don't tell us what we're going to feel. We're trying to solve a problem. Don't tell us what we're gonna feel, because you're in no position to dictate that. You're in no position to dictate what we're going to feel. We're going to feel very good.\"\u00a0 \"You don't have the cards right now,\" Mr. Trump said, as Zelenskyy continued to interject and disagree. \"With us, you start having cards. Right now, you don't have your playing cards, your playing cards \u2014 you're gambling with the lives of millions of people. \"You're gambling with World War III. You're gambling with World War III.\"\n\"Have you said 'thank you' once, this entire meeting? No, in this entire meeting, have you said 'thank you,'\" Vance said.\u00a0 Zelenskyy kept a measured tone throughout the entire exchange, even as Mr. Trump and Vance at times raised their voices.\u00a0 \"Please,\" Zelenskyy said. \"You think that if you will speak very loudly about the war\u2014\" Mr. Trump cut off Zelenskyy and said his country is in \"big trouble\" but \"you have a damn good chance of coming out okay because of us.\"\u00a0 Zelenskyy said his country has stayed strong from the beginning of the war, and Ukrainians are thankful.\u00a0 \"It's going to be a very hard thing to do business like this,\" Mr. Trump said, as Vance again chided Zelenskyy about saying \"thank you.\" Mr. Trump said it's \"good\" for the American people to see what's going on.\n\"You have to be thankful,\" Mr. Trump said. \"You don't have the cards. You're buried there, people are dying, you're running low on soldiers.\" Zelenskyy said Ukraine wants the war to end but must have security assurances along with any sort of ceasefire agreement.\u00a0 Amid the chaos, a reporter asked \u2014 what if Russia violates a ceasefire? \"What if anything?\" Mr. Trump responded. \"What if a bomb drops on your head right now? Okay?\"\u00a0 Earlier in their meeting, before it grew heated, Zelenskyy said negotiations can't only entail talk of a ceasefire, as Mr. Trump pushes for a ceasefire agreement without security assurances included.\u00a0 \"Just ceasefire will never work,\" Zelenskyy said, adding that \"25 times\" Putin \"broke his own signature,\" or violated his word on agreements.\u00a0 \"But he never broke to me,\" Mr. Trump said.\nA White House official said that the Ukrainians \"have been difficult to negotiate with [for] quite some time,\" and the Oval Office argument was \"the tipping point.\" The minerals deal would have been a \"first step to a lasting peace,\" but Zelenskyy \"overplayed his cards.\" The meeting went so poorly that after it ended, Mr. Trump continued to criticize Zelenskyy on social media, saying he is \"not ready for peace.\"\u00a0 \"We had a very meaningful meeting in the White House today,\" Mr. Trump wrote on Truth Social. \"Much was learned that could never be understood without conversation under such fire and pressure. It's amazing what comes out through emotion, and I have determined that President Zelenskyy is not ready for Peace if America is involved, because he feels our involvement gives him a big advantage in negotiations. I don't want advantage, I want PEACE. He disrespected the United States of America in its cherished Oval Office. He can come back when he is ready for Peace.\" \u00a0 Zelenskyy was spotted leaving the White House at 1:41 p.m. After his team was told to leave the White House, Zelenskyy posted on X : \"Thank you America, thank you for your support, thank you for this visit. Thank you\u00a0 @POTUS , Congress, and the American people. Ukraine needs just and lasting peace, and we are working exactly for that.\" Zelenskyy was scheduled to speak at the Hudson Institute in Washington Friday afternoon, but according to event organizers, Zelenskyy's office informed them he would not be coming.\u00a0 As Mr. Trump left for his Mar-a-Lago property in Florida on Friday afternoon, CBS News asked him what Zelensky needs to do in order for Mr. Trump to restart talks.\n\"He's gotta say, 'I wanna make peace,'\" Mr. Trump said. \"He doesn't have to stand there and say about, 'Putin this, Putin that.' All negative things. He's gotta say, 'I wanna make peace. I don't want to fight a war any longer.' His people are dying. He doesn't have the cards just so you understand it, okay?\" Administration sources on next steps High-level sources with the Trump administration told CBS News that Ukrainian officials reached out Friday afternoon to senior White House officials desperate to get the deal back on track. However, they were told that would not happen today. Mr. Trump was unwilling to talk to Zelenskyy further today, the sources said.\u00a0 When Rubio and Waltz went into the Roosevelt Room of the White House to ask Zelenskyy to leave, they made it clear that any further engagements Friday would be counterproductive, the sources said, adding that Waltz told Zelenskyy that he had made a tremendous mistake and a disservice to Ukraine and to the U.S. No phone calls between Mr. Trump and Putin have been scheduled, the sources added, while multiple European officials have called top Trump officials since Zelenskyy departed the White House asking how the minerals deal can be salvaged.\u00a0 Zelenskyy will meet British Prime Minister Keir Starmer on Saturday, Starmer's office said, ahead of a wider summit of European leaders in London on Sunday to discuss a peace plan for Ukraine, Reuters news agency reported. Regarding Zelenskyy's request for military guarantees, the U.S. made it clear Mr. Trump wanted an economic partnership, and then they would talk about the guarantees as part of the ceasefire if it happened, the sources said. There was no discussion among Trump officials about putting U.S. boots on the ground. The sources said that the White House is uncertain if it can help facilitate an end to the fighting. Mr. Trump is not seeking regime change in Ukraine, the sources said, and there have been no discussions about who in Ukraine might be a better leader than Zelenskyy.\nWhat to know about Zelenskyy's White House visit Mr. Trump mentioned earlier this week that the U.S. had reached a deal with Zelenskyy on a broad framework for sharing Ukraine's\u00a0 mineral resources , and that the Ukrainian leader was coming to the White House because he \"would like to sign it together with me.\" Negotiations over the minerals continued despite public tension between the two leaders in recent days. Mr. Trump appeared to blame Ukraine for the war Russia started and labeled Zelenskyy a \"dictator,\" while declining to say the same of Russian President Vladimir Putin.\u00a0 One Ukrainian official told CBS News Kyiv hopes the signing of the agreement would ensure the continued flow of security support that Ukraine needs. Mr. Trump said Thursday the deal would help pay back American taxpayers for supporting Ukraine over the past three years.\nPresident Trump greets Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy as he arrives at the White House on Feb. 28, 2025.\nGetty Images\nIn a post on X Wednesday, Zelenskyy wrote , \"Peace and security guarantees are the key to ensuring that Russia can no longer destroy the lives of other nations.\" He added, \"For me and for all of us in the world, it's important that U.S. support is not stopped. Strength is needed on the path to peace.\" Mr. Trump spoke with Putin earlier this month and said the Russian leader wants an end to the war. Last week, the president said he trusts Russia to negotiate in good faith, as top Trump administration officials met with Russian negotiators in Saudi Arabia without a Ukrainian representative. The president on Thursday said he believes Putin would comply with any peace agreement reached.\u00a0 \"I don't believe he's going to violate his word,\" Mr. Trump said.\u00a0 Mr. Trump last week called Zelenskyy a \"dictator,\" \u00a0referring to the fact that the Ukrainian leader's five-year term expired last year, and no new election has been held. Ukraine has been under martial law since soon after the war started in 2022, and the country's constitution bans elections during martial law. On Monday, during a meeting with French President Emmanuel Macron, Mr. Trump was asked whether he views Putin as a dictator, since he called Zelenskyy one.\u00a0 \"I don't use those words lightly, I think that we're going to see how it all works out,\" he replied. \"Let's see what happens.\"\nMr. Trump has even cast blame on Kyiv for being invaded by Russia. \"You should have never started it, you could have made a deal,\" Mr. Trump said of Ukraine last week.\u00a0 Top Trump administration officials have also been reluctant to criticize Putin. National security adviser Mike Waltz didn't answer directly when a reporter asked him if Mr. Trump views Putin as a dictator. He also sidestepped a question about who bears more responsibility for the war, Russia or Ukraine. Referring to Mr. Trump, Waltz replied, \"His goal here is to bring this war to an end, period.\" The president frequently says the war never would have started if he had been president, rather than Joe Biden. On the campaign trail, Mr. Trump vowed he would end the war between Russia and Ukraine before even taking office.\u00a0 \"Before I even arrive at the Oval Office, shortly after we win the presidency, I will have the horrible war between Russia and Ukraine settled,\" Mr. Trump said at a June rally. \"I will get it settled before I even become president.\" But after winning the election, Mr. Trump suggested that reaching peace between Russia and Ukraine might be more difficult than forging peace in the Middle East.\n\"I think actually more difficult is going to be the Russia-Ukraine situation,\" Mr. Trump said in December. \"I see that as more difficult.\" Earlier this week, Zelenskyy said he would give up the presidency if doing so would achieve lasting peace for Ukraine and membership in NATO.\u00a0 \"If to achieve peace, you really need me to give up my post, I'm ready,\" Zelenskyy said at a forum marking the three-year anniversary of Russia's full-scale invasion.\nWar in Ukraine\nMore\nMost European leaders back Zelenskyy as he joins crisis talks in London\nEuropean allies rally around Ukraine after Trump-Zelenskyy rift\nWatch video of Trump and Zelenskyy's meeting\nZelenskyy was told to leave the White House after blowup with Trump and Vance\nU.K. ready to put \"boots on the ground\" to support peace deal in Ukraine, Starmer says\nMore\nIn:\n JD Vance\nRare Earth Minerals\nUkraine\nDonald Trump\nRussia\nWhite House\nVolodymyr Zelenskyy\nKathryn Watson\nKathryn Watson is a politics reporter for CBS News Digital, based in Washington, D.C.\n\u00a9 2025 CBS Interactive Inc.

Get more news Live on \u00a0/\u00a0 Updated \u00a0 By Rebecca Shabad and Nnamdi Egwuonwu WASHINGTON \u2014 A White House meeting that was intended to kick off negotiations on a deal over Ukraine\u2019s rare earth minerals devolved Friday into a remarkable confrontation, with President Donald Trump and Vice President JD Vance chastising Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and telling him he wasn\u2019t grateful enough to the United States. The Oval Office shouting match has for now shattered hopes for the minerals deal, which Trump and his allies had presented as an important step forward for Ukraine on the road to peace with Russia more than three years after the war began. \"He disrespected the United States of America in its cherished Oval Office,\" Trump said in a post on his Truth Social website after the meeting ended. \"He can come back when he is ready for Peace.\" Follow live politics coverage here Trump dug in further hours later, telling reporters that Zelenskyy \u201coverplayed his hand\u201d and accusing the Ukrainian president of \u201clooking to go on and fight, fight, fight.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re not looking for somebody that\u2019s going to sign up a strong power and then not make peace because they feel emboldened,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWe\u2019re not looking to go into a 10-year war and play games. We want peace.\u201d After departing the White House, Zelenskyy posted on X, \u201cThank you America, thank you for your support, thank you for this visit. Thank you @POTUS, Congress, and the American people. Ukraine needs just and lasting peace, and we are working exactly for that.\u201d During a Fox News interview Friday evening, Zelenskyy reiterated his appreciation of U.S. support but rebuffed calls to apologize for his comments at the White House. \u201cI think that we have to be very open and very honest. And I\u2019m not sure that we did something bad,\u201d Zelenskyy said. Secretary of State Marco Rubio is among the Trump allies who have called on Zelenskyy to issue an apology, telling CNN in an interview Friday night that Zelensky should \u201capologize for turning this thing into the fiasco for him that it became.\u201d \u201cThere was no need for him to go in there and become antagonistic,\u201d Rubio said. \"We were hoping that that meeting would begin by: 'Thank you for everything you\u2019ve done for us. We wouldn\u2019t be where we are today without you. We wouldn\u2019t even have a chance to negotiate a piece without the help you gave us.'\" Despite Trump\u2019s assertion that Zelenskyy \u201cdoesn\u2019t have the cards\u201d to negotiate, the Ukrainian leader remained adamant Friday night that security guarantees be included in any agreement to end the war, as well as the rare earth minerals deal drafted by the Trump administration. The security guarantees, he added in the Fox News interview, are critical given what he described as a long history of Russian President Vladimir Putin disregarding ceasefire agreements. Zelenskyy made many of those same points during his meeting with Trump and Vance when the cameras were rolling. A White House official told NBC News that Trump and other U.S. officials later asked Zelenskyy to leave the White House, saying that he was not welcome back on Friday. Zelenskyy abruptly departed the White House, and a planned joint news conference with the two leaders was called off. The Oval Office exchange underscored the tension that has emerged between the United States and Ukraine \u2014 along with many of its European allies \u2014 over the tougher line that Trump has taken toward the country since coming into office. He has called Zelenskyy a \u201c dictator \u201c and falsely said that Ukraine, not Russia, started the war . Rubio said Friday that frustrations over Zelenskyy's behavior are not new, pointing to reporting by NBC News that President Biden lost his temper and raised his voice while on the phone with the Ukrainian leader, according to four people familiar with the June 2022 call. \"These frustrations are not unique to President Trump,\" Rubio said. Zelenskyy told Fox News that he believes his relationship with Trump could still be salvaged. But he said in the interview that he wants to see signs of Trump favoring Ukraine over Russia. \"I want really, him to be more at our side,\" Zelenskyy said. \"The war began when Russia brought this war to our country. And they are not right.\" President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy meet in the Oval Office on Friday. Saul Loeb / AFP - Getty Images The verbal skirmish in the Oval Office began after Vance said that the path to peace between Russia and Ukraine is diplomacy. Zelenskyy disagreed, noting that Russia had broken agreements with his government in the past. \"He killed our people, and he didn't exchange prisoners,\" Zelenskyy said about Putin. \"What kind of diplomacy, JD, you are speaking about? What do you mean?\" \"I\u2019m talking about the kind of diplomacy that\u2019s going to end the destruction of your country,\" Vance shot back. \"I think it\u2019s disrespectful for you to come into the Oval Office to try to litigate this in front of the American media right now.\" Vance has long opposed U.S. aid to Ukraine. As a senator, he voted against a $95 billion foreign aid package that included substantial funding for Ukraine. As a Senate candidate, Vance said in a 2022 podcast , \u201cI don\u2019t really care what happens to Ukraine one way or another.\u201d When Vance told Zelenskyy on Friday that Ukraine has \"manpower problems\" in recruiting troops, Zelenskyy challenged Vance, noting he had never even been to his country. \"I've actually watched and seen the stories,\" Vance responded. \"And I know, what happens is you bring people, you bring them on a propaganda tour, Mr. President.\" \"Do you think that it's respectful to come to the Oval Office of the United States of America and attack the administration that is trying to prevent the destruction of your country?\" he added. Zelenskyy said that everyone has \"problems\" during the war and suggested that the U.S. doesn't feel the effects of the war because of the \"nice ocean\" between the two countries. He said the U.S. may not feel the effects now, but added, \"You will feel it in the future.\" \"Don't tell us what we're going to feel because you're in no position to dictate that,\" Trump said, raising his voice and pointing his finger at Zelenskyy. \"You're not in a good position.\" \u201cYou\u2019re gambling with World War III,\" Trump said. \"And what you\u2019re doing is very disrespectful to the country \u2014 this country.\u201d \"I've empowered you to be a tough guy,\" Trump said. \"And I don't think you'd be a tough guy without the United States. And your people are very brave, but you're either going to make a deal or we're out, and if we're out, you'll fight it out.\" Trump and Vance repeatedly suggested that Zelenskyy was not thankful enough to the United States for its assistance. \"You're not acting at all thankful, and that's not a nice thing,\" Trump said at one point. \"Have you said thank you once, this entire meeting?\" Vance also asked. Zelenskyy has repeatedly thanked the United States for its help. In December 2022, he spoke before both chambers of Congress and his first words were: \"Thank you so much. Thank you so much for that. Thank you. It\u2019s too much for me. All this for our great people. Thank you so much. Dear Americans, in all states, cities and communities, all those who value freedom and justice, who cherish it as strongly as we Ukrainians in our cities, in each and every family, I hope my words of respect and gratitude resonate in each American heart.\" Republican allies of the president largely applauded Trump after the meeting. Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., an outspoken critic of Putin who has supported U.S. aid to Ukraine, called the meeting a \u201ccomplete, utter disaster,\u201d\u00a0and said, \u201cI don\u2019t know if we can ever do business with Zelenskyy again.\u201d Speaking to reporters outside the White House, Graham \u2014 who attended a bipartisan group of senators\u2019 meeting with Zelenskyy earlier Friday \u2014 said the Ukrainian leader \"either needs to resign and send somebody over that we can do business with, or he needs to change.\" Zelenskyy rebuffed Graham's suggestion during his Fox News interview, stating that only the Ukrainian people can demand his resignation. Meanwhile, Trump and Vance\u2019s handling of the meeting stunned Democrats, who said that they were kowtowing to Putin. \u201cWhat we saw in the Oval Office today was beyond disgraceful. Trump and Vance berating Zelenskyy \u2014 putting on a show of lies and misinformation that would make Putin blush \u2014 is an embarrassment for America and a betrayal of our allies. They\u2019re popping champagne in the Kremlin,\u201d wrote Sen. Chris Coons, D-Del., who was also part of the meeting with Zelenskyy on Friday morning. Rep. Seth Moulton, D-Mass., said during an interview on MSNBC that \"this is the beginning of the end. Putin starts not only walking all over Ukraine, but walking all over Europe.\" Trump has \u201ccompletely thrown out American tradition, Republican tradition, everything they\u2019ve run on for decades just to be beholden to Putin.\u201d Zelenskyy's visit had been expected to focus in large part on a potential deal for the U.S. to access Ukraine's rare-earth minerals, which are used to make a variety of tech products. During a Cabinet meeting on Wednesday, Trump said that the two countries had made progress on an agreement that would grant the U.S. a significant ownership stake in Ukraine\u2019s rare-earth minerals as a form of repayment for Washington\u2019s support of Kyiv since Russia's invasion. U.S. officials initiated peace talks with Russian negotiators this month in Saudi Arabia, with Secretary of State Marco Rubio leading the U.S. delegation. It was the first time Russian and American officials had met in person during the Trump administration with the express intent of bringing an end to the war in Ukraine. Trump has long accused Zelenskyy of taking undue advantage of the U.S. and goading then-President Joe Biden into spending billions of U.S. dollars on a war that \u201c couldn\u2019t be won .\u201d The minerals agreement, Trump has argued, would serve as reimbursement for the nearly $66 billion in military assistance the U.S. has provided Ukraine over the past three years, and it could create an \u201c economic partnership \u201d between the two countries. Ukraine has some of the world\u2019s largest reserves of titanium and iron ore . Many of the minerals, however, are in areas controlled by Russian troops, according to U.S. officials. Russia has proposed a similar deal that would give the U.S. ownership of rare-earth minerals and valuable metals in Russian-controlled Ukrainian territory, an idea that both Trump and Putin have signaled interest in. Zelenskyy this month rebuffed the initial U.S. offer on rare-earth minerals, saying it did not include strong enough security guarantees for Ukraine. The rejection, paired with Zelenskyy's insistence that Ukrainian officials be involved in U.S.-Russia talks to end the war, drew Trump\u2019s fury . After Zelenskyy accused Trump of living in a Russian \u201cdisinformation bubble,\u201d Trump maligned him as \u201ca Dictator without Elections,\u201d arguing without evidence that Zelenskyy decided to postpone elections as Ukraine battles Russia because of low popularity numbers. Trump later told Fox News that Zelenskyy would hamstring his efforts to negotiate an end to the war. \u201cI don\u2019t think he\u2019s very important to be at meetings, to be honest with you. He\u2019s been there for three years. He makes it very hard to make deals,\u201d Trump said. Rebecca Shabad Rebecca Shabad is a politics reporter for NBC News based in Washington.
