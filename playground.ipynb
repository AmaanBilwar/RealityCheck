The leaders of Germany, France, Spain, Poland and the Netherlands were among those who posted social media messages backing Ukraine - with Zelensky responding directly to each one to thank them for their support. The Ukrainian president has arrived in London to attend a summit hosted by UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer who \"retains unwavering support for Ukraine\", Downing Street said. It comes after extraordinary scenes in the Oval Office on Friday as US President Trump clashed with Zelensky, telling him to make a deal with Russia \"or we are out\". At one point, Trump told Zelensky he was not thankful enough for US military and political support during Ukraine's fight against Russia's invasion, and that he was \"gambling with World War Three\" . As a flurry of supportive messages for Ukraine were posted by European leaders following the row - along with posts from the prime ministers of Canada, Australia and New Zealand - Zelensky replied to each one: \"Thank you for your support.\" French President Emmanuel Macron posted: \"There is an aggressor: Russia. There is a victim: Ukraine. We were right to help Ukraine and sanction Russia three years ago - and to keep doing so.\" Dutch Prime Minister Dick Schoof said the Netherlands supports Ukraine \"now more than ever\", adding: \"We want a lasting peace and an end to the war of aggression started by Russia. For Ukraine and its people, and for Europe.\" Germany's outgoing Chancellor Olaf Scholz wrote that \"no one wants peace more than the citizens of Ukraine\", with his replacement-in-waiting Friedrich Merz adding that \"we stand with Ukraine\" and \"we must never confuse aggressor and victim in this terrible war\". Germany's foreign minister Annalena Baerbock said the \"unspeakable\" row resembled a \"bad dream\" and \"underlined that a new age of infamy has begun\". She said she would \"wholeheartedly push\" for measures that could help Ukraine \"withstand Russia's aggression even if the US withdraws support, so that it can achieve a just peace and not a capitulation\". Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said: \"Ukraine, Spain stands with you,\" while his Polish counterpart Donald Tusk wrote: \"Dear [Zelensky], dear Ukrainian friends, you are not alone.\" Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Canada \"will continue to stand with Ukraine and Ukrainians in achieving a just and lasting peace\". Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese posted that his country had \"proudly supported the brave people of Ukraine in their struggle to defend their sovereignty against the brutality of Russian aggression and in support of international law\". European Union chiefs Antonio Costa and Ursula von der Leyen assured Zelensky in a joint statement that he was \"never alone\". \"We will continue working with you for a just and lasting peace,\" they said. Reuters Poland's Tusk and France's Macron were among those posting messages of support to Zelensky There were also supportive messages for Ukraine from political leaders in Austria, Belgium, Croatia, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Ireland, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Moldova, Romania, Sweden and Slovenia. However, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban voiced his support for Trump, writing: \"Strong men make peace, weak men make war. Today President @realDonaldTrump stood bravely for peace. Even if it was difficult for many to digest. Thank you, Mr President!\" On Saturday, Nato Secretary General Mark Rutte told the BBC he had spoken with Zelensky twice following the White House meeting. He said he was \"not at liberty to say what was discussed\" but shared that he told Zelensky \"we have to respect\" what Trump has done for Ukraine so far. He said Zelensky must \"find a way\" to restore his relationship with his US counterpart.

In an interview with Fox News following his White House visit, Zelensky said his row with Trump was \"not good for both sides\" but he thought the relationship could be salvaged.

Watch in full: The remarkable exchange between Zelensky, Vance and Trump Friday's conversation soured after the US Vice-President JD Vance - who was sitting alongside other politicians in the room - told Zelensky that the war had to be ended through diplomacy. Zelensky responded by asking \"what kind of diplomacy?\", referencing a previous 2019 ceasefire deal that was agreed three years before Russia's full-scale invasion when Moscow was supporting and arming separatist fighters in Ukraine's east. The vice-president then accused Zelensky of being disrespectful and \"litigating\" the situation in front of the media. Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni has called for a summit \"without delay\" between the US, Europe and allies on Ukraine. Sir Keir's crunch talks at Downing Street on Sunday will see European leaders gear up efforts to police a future Ukraine peace deal. The UK prime minister believes a deal will have to involve US military assets providing surveillance, intelligence and potentially warplanes giving air cover to deter Russian President Vladimir Putin.
