Saul Loeb—Getty Images By Simon Shuster/Kyiv March 1, 2025 8:59 AM EST I t was evening in Kyiv when the news from the White House arrived. My dinner mate, a colonel in the Ukrainian armed forces, got a call on his phone while raising a toast, and I could hear a muffled voice urging him to watch the footage from the Oval Office. We pulled it up on the colonel’s phone and sat there, slack jawed, the fat coagulating on our plates, as my President and his President went at each other like a pair of feuding in-laws. A long moment passed before my companion rendered his verdict. Molodets, he said of President Volodymyr Zelensky. “Well done.” I had rarely heard the officer praise his commander-in-chief. But he seemed genuinely impressed. “He pushed back,\" he said of Zelensky. \"You have to respect that.” Then he paused again, looking down at the screen, and added: “But now we’re f---ed.” Since the drama erupted on Friday, the reactions in Kyiv have mostly swung between these two emotions: pride in their leader for standing up to the most powerful man in the world, and fear of what the consequences would be for Ukraine, for its military and for its chances of surviving Russia’s invasion, which entered its fourth year last week. Among Zelensky’s aides and allies, no one seemed all that surprised by what he said to President Donald Trump, nor by the tone Zelensky took. In many ways, it was classic Zelensky—proud, stubborn, courageous to the point of recklessness, and rarely capable of bearing an insult in silence. “What else was he supposed to do,” one of Zelensky’s advisers asked me on Friday night. “If somebody is wiping their feet on you, are you just supposed to take it?” As we spoke, the adviser kept his eyes fixed on his social media feed, where every Ukrainian with an internet connection seemed to be venting and interpreting what had happened to their leader. Plenty of them were livid with Zelensky. His clash with Trump threatens to rupture an alliance that has kept Ukraine alive during the war with an estimated $183 billion in financial and military aid and critical wartime intelligence that no other ally can replace. With the stakes that high, Zelensky’s political opponents and many independent analysts called Friday’s argument in the Oval Office a diplomatic catastrophe, unprecedented and inexcusable. But those closest to Zelensky knew the outburst had plenty of precedents—except, in the past, they played out behind closed doors. President Joe Biden had similar clashes with Zelensky early in the war. In the summer of 2022, the U.S. agreed to provide a massive package of military aid to Ukraine, including an advanced missile system that Biden withheld for months out of fear of drawing the U.S. deeper into the war. During a phone call to talk about the aid package, which was worth about a billion dollars, Zelensky took barely a minute to thank Biden before he began asking for more assistance. Biden lost his temper in response, chastising the Ukrainian leader for seeming ungrateful. About a year later, Zelensky received a similar dressing down from Ben Wallace, who was then the British Defense Minister. “People want to see gratitude,” Wallace said at a NATO summit in July 2023. “We’re not Amazon.” The U.K. had delivered so many de-mining vehicles to the Ukrainians, Wallace added, “that I think there’s none left.” After the spat, Wallace received so much blowback for his remarks that he issued an apology to Zelensky.\\xa0 On Friday night, it was Zelensky who faced pressure to apologize to Trump during an interview with Fox News, and he declined to offer one. “No. I respect [the] President, and I respect American people,” he said calmly. “I think we have to be very open and very honest, and I’m not sure that we did something bad.” To many Ukrainians, Zelensky was right. In the Oval Office and on Fox News, he spoke with all the conviction and self-respect that his citizens have come to expect from their leader. He has long internalized their collective pain and anger at the Russian invasion, and he has made an art of channeling those emotions as he seeks to win the support of the world. Maybe this time he chose the wrong setting to speak so freely with such a crucial ally. But the main response among my friends in Kyiv was pride in\\xa0having a leader with such a backbone.\\xa0“Every time he goes abroad, he carries with him what we feel here,” one of them told me on\\xa0Friday night. “That’s part of his job. To express those feelings to the world.”\\xa0 More Must-Reads from TIME Inside Elon Musk’s War on Washington Meet the 2025 Women of the Year The Harsh Truth About Disability Inclusion Why Do More Young Adults Have Cancer?\\xa0 Colman Domingo Leads With Radical Love How to Get Better at Doing Things Alone Cecily Strong on Goober the Clown Column: The Rise of America’s Broligarchy Contact us at letters@time.com Edit Post Home U.S. Politics World Health Business Tech Personal Finance by TIME Stamped Shopping by TIME Stamped Future of Work by Charter Entertainment Ideas Science History Sports Magazine The TIME Vault TIME For Kids TIMECO2 Coupons TIME Edge Video Masthead Newsletters Subscribe Digital Magazine Give a Gift Shop the TIME Store Careers Modern Slavery Statement Press Room TIME Studios U.S. & Canada Customer Care Global Help Center Contact the Editors Reprints and Permissions Site Map Media Kit Supplied Partner Content About Us © 2024 TIME USA, LLC.

Get more news Live on Save with a NBCUniversal Profile Create your free profile or log in to save this article By Dan De Luce An ugly and unprecedented confrontation in the Oval Office hammered home President Donald Trump’s hostility toward Ukraine and its president, along with his persistent affinity for Russia’s autocratic ruler. As television cameras rolled, Trump and Vice President JD Vance berated Volodymyr Zelenskyy, the democratically elected leader of a country that has been under attack from Russia since 2014, saying he’s “ungrateful,” “disrespectful” and “gambling with millions of lives.” The lecture left no doubt that Trump sees Ukraine merely as one of the parties in a negotiation, and not as a democratic U.S. ally grappling with the invading force of a much larger, autocratic neighbor, Russia. It also seemed to illustrate Trump’s lopsided\\xa0negotiating tactics, demanding\\xa0the weaker side — Kyiv\\xa0—\\xa0make concessions instead of trying to pressure Moscow into a compromise. The extraordinary scene left Ukraine’s ambassador to the United States, Oksana Markarova, who was in the room, holding her head in her hands — an image that went viral. Previous American presidents have had plenty of tense exchanges with allies, but often in private and never like this. What made this one different was not just that it unfolded with cameras rolling, but that it featured an American president siding with an autocratic and longtime adversary, Russia, against a nascent democracy that has struggled for years to break away from Moscow’s orbit and join the NATO alliance of Western democracies. For decades, presidents from both parties embraced the idea that backing democratic countries served America’s interests and reflected its values. U.S. foreign policy viewed democratic states as better allies and better trading partners, helping to promote stability and the free flow of commerce. But Trump, along with the Republican Party he has transformed, appears to have rejected that decades-old American consensus. For Trump, Russia is apparently a powerful country that the U.S. can cut a deal with, and Ukraine is a less powerful country that does not necessarily have a seat at the table or a sympathetic ear at the White House. Democracy doesn’t seem to figure in this president’s equation. Zelenskyy and Trump openly clashed in the White House, where they were due to sign a deal on sharing Ukraine’s mineral riches and discuss a peace deal with Russia. SAUL LOEB / AFP - Getty Images Partisan gulf After the tense exchange was broadcast, Republicans in Congress almost uniformly praised Trump for attacking Ukraine’s leader. “Thank you for standing up for OUR COUNTRY and putting America first, President Trump and Vice President Vance!” Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, posted on X . Sen. Jim Banks, R-Ind., suggested that the Ukrainian leader was spoiled. “Zelensky ungratefully expects us to bankroll and escalate another forever war—all while disrespecting the President,” he said in a statement.\\xa0“The entitlement is insulting to working Americans.” A handful of Republicans blamed Putin for the conflict. “Some want to whitewash the truth, but we cannot ignore the truth. Russia is at fault for this war,” said Rep. Don Bacon , R-Neb. Democratic lawmakers called Trump’s conduct a betrayal of democracy and an ally. Sen. Jack Reed of Rhode Island, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Armed Services Committee, condemned Trump’s treatment of Zelenskyy as a “political ambush” that played into the hands of Putin. “President Zelenskyy and the people of Ukraine are fighting for their very lives and existence,” Reed said in a statement.\\xa0“To mock Ukraine and our allies is a travesty that only benefits Putin.” Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont lambasted Trump in a post on X . “Sorry, President Trump. We believe in democracy, not authoritarianism.” House Democratic Whip Katherine Clark of Massachusetts said, “I never thought an American President would choose a Russian dictator over a democratic ally.” Across Europe, political leaders declared staunch support for Zelenskyy and his country, pledging to stand by Ukraine — without mentioning Trump. French President Emmanuel Macron said, “There is an aggressor: Russia. There is a victim: Ukraine. ... They are fighting for their dignity, their independence, their children, and the security of Europe.” Friedrich Merz,\\xa0Germany’s likely next chancellor based on the country’s recent election results, said, “We must never confuse aggressor and victim in this terrible war.” Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European Commission, praised Zelenskyy in a post on X . “Your dignity honors the bravery of the Ukrainian people. Be strong, be brave, be fearless. You are never alone,” she wrote. “We will continue working with you for a just and lasting peace.” President Donald Trump and Vice President JD Vance meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Andrew Harnik / Getty Images Trusting Putin or Zelenskyy The meeting in the Oval Office started routinely enough, with Trump saying it was “an honor” to have Zelenskyy at the White House and the two would sign an agreement that would grant the U.S. a share in Ukraine’s mineral wealth. But the divide between the two leaders became clear when reporters asked about the details of a possible ceasefire and if the U.S. was prepared to provide security guarantees to Ukraine. Trump dismissed the idea as irrelevant. “I don’t want to talk about security yet, because I want to get the deal done,” Trump said. “Security is so easy, that’s about 2% of the problem. I’m not worried about security. I’m worried about getting the deal done.” For months, Zelenskyy has argued that any ceasefire or peace agreement has to include security commitments from European countries and the U.S. to help arm and protect Ukraine from further aggression from Russia. European leaders have endorsed Zelenskyy’s stance, and France and the United Kingdom have indicated they would be ready to send troops to back up a peace accord. Putin’s track record in negotiating peace deals has not reassured the Ukrainians. During the meeting, Zelenskyy recounted how Russia had violated a previous ceasefire earlier in the war, before Moscow’s full-scale invasion in 2022. “That’s why we will never accept just [a] ceasefire,” he said. The fireworks erupted when Vance said former President Joe Biden had only offered empty threats and that it was time to pursue diplomacy. Zelenskyy, appearing exasperated, asked Vance “what kind of diplomacy” he was referring to. The Ukrainian president recounted how Russia’s military onslaught against Ukraine had begun more than 10 years ago in the Crimean Peninsula and in the country’s east, that the world had failed to stop Russia and that diplomacy had failed.\\xa0Putin, he argued, could not be trusted. Vance shot back: “Mr. President, with respect. I think it’s disrespectful for you to come to the Oval Office to try to litigate this in front of the American media.” As Zelenskyy tried to respond, Trump berated him. “What you’re doing is very disrespectful to the country, this country that’s backed you far more than a lot of people say they should have.” Zelenskyy warned Trump and Vance that without Ukraine holding Russia back, Putin would eventually strike at NATO’s eastern flank in the Baltics and Poland, possibly pulling America into a conflict. A White House official told NBC News that Zelenskyy was subsequently asked to leave. After his departure, Trump posted online, “He can come back when he is ready for Peace.” In an interview with Fox News later in the day, Zelenskyy said the public quarrel at the White House was “not good” for either side. And he said Ukrainians “just want to hear that America is on our side and that America will stay with us, not with Russians.” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy leaves the White House on Friday. Andrew Harnik / Getty Images Trump’s perception of Ukraine Before the Oval Office confrontation, Trump was asked by a reporter if he was on Ukraine’s side in proposed peace negotiations with Russia or if he saw himself as a mediator “in the middle.” Trump said he was “in the middle,” trying to bring an end to the war. But Trump’s harsh words for Ukraine in the Oval Office, his recent comments that Kyiv “started the war” and that Zelenskyy is a “dictator” suggested he is more inclined to Russia’s point of view. Trump expressed sympathy for the Russian autocrat. He said he and Putin had both been victims of what he has described as false allegations surrounding the 2016 election. U.S. intelligence officials and a Senate report concluded Russia tried to influence the outcome of that election in Trump’s favor and that Moscow operatives reached out to the Trump campaign. “He had to suffer through the Russia hoax,” Trump said. In Moscow, Zelenskyy’s rough reception at the White House was greeted with delight. Dmitry Medvedev, Russia’s former president and the deputy chair of the country’s security council, lauded Trump for telling Zelenskyy “the truth to his face for the first time” and agreed with the American president that Ukraine could ignite World War III. Medvedev described Zelenskyy as “an ungrateful pig” who “got a solid slap from the pigsty owners.” Dan De Luce Dan De Luce\\xa0is a reporter for the NBC News Investigative Unit.\\xa0 About Contact Help Careers Ad Choices Privacy Policy Your Privacy Choices CA Notice Terms of Service (Updated JULY 7, 2023) NBC News Sitemap Closed Captioning Advertise Select Shopping ©\\xa02025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC NBC News Logo MSNBC Logo Today Logo\"}, {'title': 'Zelensky told to leave White House after angry spat with Trump and ...', 'source': 'bbc.com', 'date': '2025-03-01T20:35:28Z', 'url': 'https://www.bbc.com/news/live/c625ex282zzt', 'snippet': 'Just before the heated exchange in the Oval Office, Zelensky faced questioning and comments over his choice to wear combat gear from a ...', 'content': 'Zelensky told to leave White House after angry spat with Trump and Vance - BBC News BBC Homepage Skip to content Accessibility Help Your account Home News Sport Business Innovation Culture Travel Earth Video Live More menu More menu Search BBC Home News Sport Business Innovation Culture Travel Earth Video Live Close menu BBC News Menu Home Israel-Gaza war War in Ukraine Climate Video World US & Canada UK Business Tech More Science Entertainment & Arts Health In Pictures BBC Verify World News TV Newsbeat World Africa Asia Australia Europe Latin America Middle East Zelensky told to leave White House after angry spat with Trump and Vance 27 February 2025 Summary For technical reasons, we\\'re moving our live coverage of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky\\'s dramatic visit to the White House to a new page - click this link to stay with us.

A planned appearance by President Zelensky at a think tank earlier this evening was cancelled at the last minute – after the buffet had already been served. Ukrainian officials are still trying to process what happened today. But there’s no doubt in government circles that this trip has gone terribly wrong. A day that was meant to bring about a new chapter in US-Ukraine relations has ended with the two sides in uncharted territory. US support has proven critical for Ukraine’s survival – President Zelensky said as much on Fox News this evening. He heads to London on Saturday to meet UK prime minister Sir Keir Starmer, an important ally. But Kyiv will be thinking hard about how to salvage damaged relations with their most important partner - the United States.

The United States must not reward Russian aggression and continue to appease Putin.\" Senator Jeanne Shaheen, the most senior Democrat on the Foreign Relations Committee, to a reporter: \"It\\'s distressing to see the President... is walking away from our commitment in Ukraine, and doesn\\'t seem to understand what a murderous dictator Vladimir Putin is.\" Representative Gregory Meeks, the most senior Democrat on the House Foreign Affairs Committee: \"Trump’s actions today undermined U.S. leadership, emboldened our adversaries, humiliated both himself and his Republican Party, and insulted the generations of Americans who fought and died to build America’s standing in the world.

It was Donald Trump.” Senator Tammy Duckworth, a combat veteran : \"Attacking our democratic partner in service of an autocratic dictator.\\nTrump is a national disgrace.\" Representative Ted Lieu, a long-serving member of the House who sits on the Foreign Affairs Committee: \"Nobody is celebrating President Trump and Vice President Vance’s embarrassing behavior in the Oval Office more than Vladimir Putin. Today was a distressing moment for those of us who value democracy and America’s role as a force for good.\" Senator Chris Murphy, a more liberal Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee who has emerged as one of Trump\\'s fiercest critics, on X: \"What just happened in the Oval Office was a planned ambush, designed to help a brutal Russian dictator and hurt America\\'s security.\\nTrump has become Putin\\'s lapdog, and America\\'s global power is hemorrhaging as America sides with dictators over democracy. What an embarrassment.\" Share close panel Share page Copy link About sharing Who asked Zelensky ‘Why don’t you wear a suit?’ published at 00:19 Greenwich Mean Time 1 March 00:19 GMT 1 March Mike Wendling US digital reporter Image source, Getty Images Image caption, Brian Glenn, pictured with girlfriend Marjorie Taylor Greene, asked about the Ukrainian leader\\'s wardrobe Just before the heated exchange in the Oval Office, Zelensky faced questioning and comments over his choice to wear combat gear from a conservative journalist. The wardrobe question presaged the argument about thankfulness and respect. \"Why don\\'t\\nyou wear a suit? Do you own a suit? A lot of Americans have a problem with you\\nnot respecting the dignity of the office,\" the reporter asked. Zelensky has made a habit of wearing sweatshirts, usually\\nadorned with the Ukrainian trident symbol, even when at important meetings with\\nworld leaders. He seemed unperturbed by the question. \"I will wear (a) costume after this war will finish,”\\nhe told the reporter. “Maybe something like yours, maybe something better…\\nMaybe something cheaper.\" The question was posed by Brian Glenn, the Chief White House\\nCorrespondent for Real America’s Voice, a right-wing network with a show line-up\\nchock-full of Trump allies. It’s unclear how salty the Ukrainian president meant to be in\\nhis answer - the word “suit” can be translated into Ukrainian as “kostyum” - and\\nthe news conference swiftly moved on.

Welcome to the final session of the Winter/Spring 2023 CFR Academic Webinar Series. I’m Irina Faskianos, vice president of the National Program and Outreach here at CFR.\\nToday’s discussion is on the record. And the video and transcript will be available on our website, CFR.org/Academic, if you would like to share these materials with your colleagues or classmates. As always, CFR takes no institutional positions on matters of policy.\\nWe are delighted to have Carolyn Kissane with us to discuss the geopolitics of oil. Dr. Kissane is the academic director of both the graduate program in global affairs and the graduate program in global security conflict and cybercrime at NYU’s Center for Global Affairs, where she is also a clinical professor. She also serves as director of the energy, climate justice, and sustainability lab in the School of Professional Studies at NYU. She was named in 2013 by Breaking Energy as one of the top ten New York women in energy, and top ten energy communicator. She’s a member of the Council on Foreign Relations and the National Committee on U.S.-China Relations, and serves on several boards.\\nSo, Carolyn, thanks very much for doing this. We really appreciate it.\\nI thought we could begin by talking about how has the geopolitics of oil changed, especially vis-à-vis Russia’s war in Ukraine and OPEC’s recent announcement to cut oil production?\\nKISSANE: Well, first of all, I’d just like to say, thank you so very much for having me. I’m really delighted. I am a big fan of CFR’s Academic Webinars. So, to have the opportunity to participate in this—in this way is very meaningful to me. So, thank you.\\nSo, wow. There is so much happening in this space, the geopolitics of oil. This has been a tremendous fourteen months. Russia’s reinvasion of Ukraine very much upended the geopolitics of oil because Russia is a significant producer, one of the top three in the world.\\nAnd it’s—you know, it’s caused a kind of a reshaping, a kind of a remapping of the—of oil geopolitics. And we’ve seen some, you know, shifts in how countries think about oil security, in light of larger questions about broader energy security questions. And also, on top of that, is the ongoing energy transition, coupled with, you know, climate change, and the need to decarbonize.\\nSo, there’s just—it’s been quite a—you know, a year and a half, that has really sort of put energy security, and oil security, very much at the forefront of people’s minds.\\nFASKIANOS: Fantastic.\\nI thought maybe you had some really interesting data to show us. And if you could walk us through those—the trends you are seeing and really bring it to life, that would be fantastic.\\nKISSANE: Sure.\\nSo, before I do—I have a couple of slides. And before I share my slides, I think it’s really important that, sort of, we understand how interconnected, sort of, the global energy system is, and how interconnected we are, when it comes to the flows of oil.\\nYou know, some countries are very well resourced-endowed, so they have oil. And other countries do not, so they need to import oil. There’s really no country in the world that doesn’t need oil for larger national security issues. And I think one of things that many people sort of are not necessarily aware of or think about, is the amount of oil that gets produced every day.\\nSo, every day, the world consumes over 100 million barrels a day. And every day, that 100 million barrels has to be—has to be moved. It has to be—you know, as part of getting it into the system, getting it to its respective destinations. And what we’re not seeing—which, maybe some people may have thought that we would see at this point—is we’re not seeing a reduction in demand, but we’re seeing an expansion in demand. And much of that global demand is coming out of Asia. And we’re also, of course, seeing the—with the reopening of China, lots of really interesting questions as to what oil demand will be in China for the 2023-2024 years, whether or not they will—they will, sort of, put extra pressure on global demand.\\nAnd you know, Irina, just also, you know, it’s—I’m going to share this in my slides. But you know, last week’s decision from OPEC+ to reduce production, of course, had an impact on the price of oil. So when the decision was announced on Sunday, by Monday morning, we saw an uptick in the price. It’s stabilized, but we are sort of looking at $80-plus-a-barrel oil. And again, lots of uncertainty as to what that’s going to mean across economies that are in recessions, experiencing sort of the beginnings of a recession, and sort of what does it mean for the global economy, where we may see sort of more energy inflation.\\nSo, one of the things that I really like to do when I teach the geopolitics of oil is sort of show some visuals. Because I think, again, sort of, really reinforcing the interconnected nature of our global energy system, but also sort of seeing where in the world is oil produced, and where in the world are the—are the importers. And also, just a couple of sort of fun pieces on what we have seen, just this—you know, in the last week, of course, some of this—you’ll be familiar with, those in the audience—but this decision on the part of OPEC to reduce production by 1.2 million barrels a day—again, happening at a time, not when we have an excess supply, but when we’re seeing a tight supply across the oil market. So, it came as a bit of a surprise to—you know—to even the most, you know, longstanding analysts and OPEC observers.\\nAnd again, part of this is directed probably toward self-interests on the part of Saudi Arabia and the oil producers that are really going to make the cuts. But of course, it also has an impact here for those of you that are sitting in the United States. What does it mean then for prices that Americans pay at the gas pump? So, the Biden administration sort of came out after this decision was made in sort of being disappointed, surprised that OPEC would make this decision.\\nNow, it’s also important to sort of recognize that this is not just a singular OPEC decision. This is part of, now, a larger OPEC+. And OPEC+ does also include Russia, as well as other countries like Kazakhstan and Mexico. So, the OPEC that we have historically known is now different, because you have other countries that are not official members but nonetheless are part of what we now refer to as OPEC+.\\nAnd these are the countries that are part of OPEC, and really the country that’s considered to be sort of in the driver’s seat of OPEC is that of Saudi Arabia, because Saudi Arabia is the largest producer within the OPEC organization, producing anywhere from 10 to 11 million barrels a day. Venezuela has the largest reserves, but it is far from being at capacity, in terms of what it can—what it can produce. So, just to kind of put that into perspective, these are OPEC countries and their respective reserves.\\nAnd then non-OPEC—the United States being a non-OPEC country, but again, this sort of—this chart to the right shows, you know, again, the world is consuming a little over 100 million barrels a day, expected to increase over 2023 and into 2024, question marks as to when we may see peak oil demand.\\nBut again, to sort of link this to energy security—energy security, especially when it’s in the context of oil security—is making sure that we have adequate supply at affordable prices. So, when we see a reduction in supply at a time of tight markets, that suggests that we’re also going to see higher prices that’s going to directly hit vulnerable economies.\\nAnd so, again, just to sort of point out sort of where in the world sort of are the top three oil producers: the United States, Saudi Arabia, and Russia. Russia remains in the top three. Canada as well, our, you know, neighbor to the north. And China is also a producer of oil. The United States figure here also includes gas liquefied, so liquid petroleum, which the United States is endowed with a lot of both oil and natural gas.\\nAnd then the top oil consuming countries, you have U.S., China, and India. Now, the United States is not the largest importer. That position is now held by China. But as far as consumption goes, we consume over 20 million barrels a day. Again, big question mark about China, in terms of whether or not we will see higher demand coming out of China over the next year, two years, with China’s reopening and what is being, you know, discussed as revenge tourism. And more Chinese who have accumulated a lot of savings, 2.1 trillion, how are they going to use that savings and whether or not, after three years of being under lockdown restrictions, whether or not we’ll see impacts to demand.\\nAnd I think Russia is—there’s lots of questions about Russia. And this is now—we’re fourteen months into, you know, Russia’s reinvasion of Ukraine—and I emphasize reinvasion, because oftentimes, we forget that, you know, Russia invaded Ukraine in 2014. But Russia is still moving its oil. And up until, you know, a few months ago, its overall production and exports were as high—at some points, even higher—than pre-invasion. Now, you have new countries that are takers of Russian oil, and they’re buying it at discounted prices. We see Turkey, Singapore, China has been a big buyer, as well as India, that they have been buying discounted Russian oil. Lots of interesting questions that we could discuss about the oil price cap and seaborne embargo to Europe. But I think the takeaway from this slide is that Russia continues to produce oil, continues to sell it, selling at a discounted price, but there are still many countries in the world that are eager to take Russian oil.\\nAnd again, I’m not going to go into this, but I just love this slide, to just emphasize the—you know, the world’s pipelines. These are the pipelines that help sort of the transit of oil. Something also that’s really unique and interesting to look at is just tanker traffic, so, the tankers that carry oil around the world. But again, you know, there are a lot of pipelines, so twenty-three—two thousand, three hundred, and eighty-one operational oil and gas pipelines. Again, these are—it’s moving a lot of the oil that is consumed every day.\\nAnd then finally, is this—is—you know, one of the things that we oftentimes—we think about the hundred million barrels a day that the world is consuming, over 75 percent of the world’s oil is controlled, managed by state-owned oil companies. So, Saudi Aramco being one, PDVSA of Venezuela being another. But it’s really important to sort of recognize the position that state-owned companies have. The rest is controlled or managed by international oil companies—ExxonMobil, Chevron, ENI, Total, and a host of other—host of other companies.\\nBut again, I think the—you know, to understand that NOCs, as they’re referred to, are very, very important for understanding their role in the larger context of the geopolitics of oil.\\nAnd again, what we saw last week coming out of OPEC, this decision, this is also being driven by state budget concerns. This is—again, it’s about the production of oil, but it’s also about, you know, governments and their budgets. And oftentimes, you know, there is a desire to add more, rather than—you know, more revenues rather than less.\\nSo, those are the slides that I have. And I hope that they sort of provide some sort of context, and a little bit of, you know, that we can discuss in the questions that I really look forward to answering from the audience.\\nFASKIANOS: Thank you, Carolyn. That was great.\\nSo now, we’re going to go to all of you for your questions and comments.\\n(Gives queuing instructions.)\\nAll right, so I’m going to go to the first raised hand in the thing. Amadine Hom, go to you first, and please accept the—unmute yourself.\\n(Pause.)\\nYou are still muted.\\n(Pause.)\\nOK, I don’t know—are you there? Oh, I think—OK.\\nLet’s go to Morton Holbrook.\\nQ: Yes, good afternoon.\\nDr. Kissane, what a shocking presentation—(laughs)—a hundred million barrels a day and it’s going up, notwithstanding the Paris Climate Agreement of 2015. Is that agreement simply a dead letter, or is it having any effect on oil—on fossil fuel production, particularly oil production? Or what’s the best scenario, in terms of reducing dependence on fossil fuels, considering the oil market?\\nThank you.\\nKISSANE: Well—hi, Morton, thank you so much for that excellent question.\\nYeah, that’s kind of why I emphasize that number, is because a lot of people sort of just aren’t aware of how much oil we continue to consume, and again, what the demand expectations are moving forward. And these demand expectations are, you know, coming out of forecasts from the International Energy Agency.\\nSo, I think there’s a big question as to when we see peak demand. And, you know, if you look at BP scenarios, they expect peak demand to happen, you know, before 2030, where, as, you know, others kind of contest that they—that they think that peak demand won’t happen until after 2030. I mean, again, a lot depends on, you know, what we are now experiencing in the energy transition, and how, sort of quickly are we—can we transition away from oil.\\nI think what’s really critical, when we’re looking at oil, is oftentimes we think only about the transportation sector. So we’re thinking about cars, we’re thinking about planes, you know, we’re thinking about trucks, and tankers, and all these things. But it’s petrochemicals, you know? There’s just a lot of oil that also goes into fertilizer. So, it really is across our economy, and across economies, across the global system.\\nOne of the things that I always tell my students is even during COVID, where you had many countries, right, much of the world was experiencing some level of lockdown, we did have a reduction in oil demand, but it wasn’t—it wasn’t like 20 million barrels. It was under ten.\\nSo, the fact that now it’s 2023, the world has reopened, it’s really hard to sort of see, or to know with certainty, is when we’re going to see that—see that reduction in demand.\\nNow, I think with the Paris Agreement, what’s also important is—to note is, you know, if you’re—if you’re in the oil and gas space—and I was just at a conference earlier this morning where this was a point of conversation—was, you know, what are the companies doing to reduce the emissions from production? So, how are they integrating carbon capture, sequestration, you know, how are they managing the emissions that come from the production of fossil energy—in this case that we’re talking about, oil.\\nAnd I think one of the things that—I think if you sort of follow oil markets, or a country like Saudi Arabia, they are marketing low-emission oil. Now, we could—you know, we could sort of challenge, well, what does that—you know, what does that really mean? But you are having, you know, countries that are now sort of competing to state that they have lower emitting carbon in the production—in the production of oil. And that’s a whole other interesting sort of thing to look at, in the context of the geopolitics of oil, is to kind of understand the variation across emissions, across different countries, in the production of oil.\\nSo, we are—you know, again, we are going to be going into COP-28 this fall. Again, we are not seeing—you know, and we haven’t seen a, you know, reduction in fossil energy demand. Again, lots of people are sort of, you know, hoping that we’ll start to see it sooner rather than later. But for the time being—and again, you know, to Irina’s first question, that, you know, the last fourteen months, and with, you know, with Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, it has both shown us that, you know, Europe is sort of seeking to hasten the energy transition, by building out more renewable energy, and creating more opportunities to buy electric vehicles.\\nBut there’s still big swaths of the world that, you know, are still, and have yet to move towards, you know, really reducing—and that are actually going to see higher demand moving forward, as their economies grow.\\nFASKIANOS: Thank you.\\nI’m going to take the next question from Jovana Vujanic, who is a graduate student at Lewis University: How big of an—of an impact will the decision of the Saudi energy minister to cut oil production have on the relationship between the United States and Saudi Arabia?\\nKISSANE: Love the question, thank you so much. Yeah, no, it’s a great one.\\nSo, my take is that, of course, this decision came as a bit of a surprise, and it wasn’t something that the United States, you know, wanted. But I would say that the U.S.-Saudi relationship has been very tense for the last ten years. And as part of that—there are lots of different reasons for that, but this is yet—kind of another thing that Saudi has done.\\nAnd again, I think it’s also—Saudi has taken a non-alignment policy with relation to its position on Russia and Ukraine. So, it continues to—you know, it continues to have a relationship with Russia. It also has the relationship with Ukraine. As we saw, you know, China just brokered a very significant deal between Saudi Arabia and Iran. You know, again, Saudi Arabia and Iran are two—are two important producers for China. So, China is a large importer of oil.\\nSo, if you go back to World War—the end of World War II, that’s when the United States established the oil-for-security relationship with Saudi Arabia. And as we have grown, sort of, more—I wouldn’t say independent, but our—as our own oil production has increased, especially through the shale revolution, our dependence on the Middle East and Saudi Arabia, more specifically, has shifted.\\nSo, I think we’re seeing a very different Saudi Arabia today, which I think is going to be a challenge for the United States. I think it’s going to be very interesting to see what the summer holds. Last summer, the Biden administration did tap into the U.S. strategic petroleum reserves, the largest—the largest take in the history of the reserves, which started in 1975, you know, taking 180 million barrels out, you know, not because there was massive supply disruptions. But because, you know, as the administration said, it was—you know, it was—it was—it was a war—it was a war-specific decision, because the—you know, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine was causing energy prices to skyrocket. And to cushion the American consumer, and to better cushion the, sort of, the global economy, the United States withdrew from the SPR. So I think the summer is going to be very interesting.\\nBut I think we’re going to see, definitely, much more attention in the years to come, between the United States and Saudi Arabia. It’s not the relationship of the past. This is a kind of a very new relationship.\\nThat’s a great question.\\nFASKIANOS: Thank you. Thank you, let’s go Curran Flynn, who has a raised hand.\\nQ: Hello?\\nFASKIANOS: We can hear you, but we’re getting feedback. So you might have two devices open.\\nQ: Can you hear me now?\\nFASKIANOS: Yes.\\nQ: That’s better. OK.\\nFASKIANOS: That’s better. Thank you. Thank you so much.\\nQ: So, I’m here at King Fahd University in Saudi Arabia, right next to Aramco, here with my class from international relations. And one of my students has a question, Nasser al-Nasir (ph). Here he is.\\nQ: So, thank you, Mrs. Carolyn.\\nMy question is: How could Russia’s use of alternative transportation methods, such as the East Siberian Pipeline to China, impact the U.S. market, the domestic market, and the role of the SPR, given potential insurance workarounds from Russia’s side such as ensuring Russian tankers through their RDIF fund?\\nAnd thank you to Mrs. Irina.\\nKISSANE: Thank you. And, Dr. Flynn, thank you so much for having your students join this webinar.\\nSo, I’m a little—so, the question is about the East Siberian Pipeline? Just could you—would you mind repeating it? I just want to make sure I have it—I’m clear on the question.\\nQ: So, how could Russia’s use of alternative transportation methods, such as the East Siberian Pipeline to China, impact the U.S. energy markets, I mean domestically, and the SPR, given potential insurance workarounds from Russia’s side such as ensuring Russian tankers to the RDIF fund?\\nKISSANE: Yeah, and that’s a great question.\\nYou know, I think that, you know, begs a lot of things that we could be looking at, right, in terms of, you know, Russia’s kind of ability or capacity to sort of work around, or find workarounds, to the sanctions that were imposed. And I think we’ve seen sort of new markets—so, this kind of reshaping of the energy map with oil, we see that as—kind of in technicolor, right, whereas, you know, a lot of Russian oil would go west, is now going east, you know, China, India, being takers, and of course, you know, other countries as well.\\nYou know, what will be its impact on the—on the U.S. market? I think that’s—you know, again, I do think the sanctions were sort of carefully put into place, so that there wouldn’t be massive disruptions, so we—again, you know, Russia produces over 10 million barrels a day, and about 7 million of those barrels are exported. So, you know, if we lost all of that, that would be a—you know, that would cause some very significant economic disruption globally. We already saw, you know, impacts to sort of grains, grain exports, and food security in many different parts of the world.\\nSo, you know, Russia is finding different ways. You have shadow tankers that Russia is using to move—to move its oil—as you pointed out, the East Siberian pipeline. You know, I think there’s only so much the United States can do, or—and European countries that are part of the sanctions regime, can do to curtail Russian exports of oil.\\nBut I think that—you know, I think Russia, again, has a—has a desire, and also, you know, revenue needs—they’re funding a very expensive war—that they’re finding ways to get their—to get their oil out. I think an interesting question is, you know, what does this mean in the years ahead, the lack of investment, for example, that’s going into Russian energy infrastructure, a lack of, sort of, any kind of Western investment that is—that is going in, and what that is going to mean.\\nBut again, you know, I think, to your question, I think we will see some—you know, we are seeing some impacts, right? There’s a big question as to what—you know, what the next six months to a year will look like, with regards to the reduction from OPEC, and if we were to see a deeper curtailment on Russian oil.\\nAnd you know, would the United States then tap more into the SPR? We’re now at—you know, we’re down to seven hundred thousand barrels, which, of course, is not insignificant. But we also sort of have to be, you know, judicious about how we use the SPR.\\nBut thank you for the question.\\nFASKIANOS: Thank you.\\nI’m going to take the next question from Michael—let’s see— Trevett, a Ph.D. candidate at the University of Southern Mississippi: China and other countries claim there are petroleum reserves under the South China Sea. What are your estimates of the potential amount there, and has China begun to extract any of this oil?\\nKISSANE: Michael, thank you so much. That’s a great question.\\nSo, China already is an oil producing country, so you do have oil production in China. In the South China Sea, I can’t—I can’t say exactly. I know that there have been geological tests that have shown the reserves. Again, you do have—you know, you do have territorial concerns about sort of where—is this—you know, can China—can China tap those—or seek to explore and tap those reserves, again, if there are—if there is contention over the territory in which these reserves are located?\\nSo you know, China, again—one of the things that’s very interesting about China is that China is an oil producer, but China has seen, over the last, you know, the last decade, they have seen that they have experienced peak demand. So—I mean, sorry. Peak supply. So, they are not producing as much as they used to. And so you’re seeing a year-on-year reduction in the producing capacity.\\nYou know, if you go back maybe five or six years ago, there was lots of questions about if China could kind of replicate what happened in the United States around the shale oil revolution. I think one of the big challenges for China is that, of the—you know, where the shale reserves are located, it’s not near water, lots of questions as to—and some of it—basically, some of the tests have shown that it’s—it definitely is proving harder that, you know, they cannot sort of model the same level of development that we have seen in the United States.\\nSo, yeah, no, I think in the South China Sea, again, I think we—it’s potentially possible that we might see it. I wouldn’t—I wouldn’t—I wouldn’t say it’s soon.\\nFASKIANOS: Thank you.\\nI’m taking the next question from Rob Warren at the Anglo-American University of Prague. This question also got an upvote: How do you foresee Venezuela’s role in the global oil market changing moving forward? And can it be reintegrated into the global economy?\\nKISSANE: Oh, these are all fantastic questions. Thank you all so much.\\nYeah, Venezuela is—again, you know, Venezuela has—they have the largest reserves in the world. As part of this webinar, right, you—CFR had a—kind of a primer on Venezuelan, and kind of—you know, you look at sort of where Venezuela is. And one of the biggest challenges confronting Venezuela is both its politics, but it’s also—it basically—you know, you don’t have—you don’t have international oil service providers in the country. I think the only—the only one now that the U.S.—the U.S. has sort of given a sanctions exemption to, is that of Chevron.\\nBut I think—yeah, I mean, if you were to see, you know, kind of shifts in the political regime, and you were to see more openness, then I think you could imagine, you know, Venezuela having an opportunity, or a pathway forward, to be more integrated into the global energy system, and the global oil system. You know, I think one of the big problems that Venezuela faces is that most of its infrastructure is really old at this point. And it would need a significant amount of reinvestment to get it up to a place that it could sort of meet its potential.\\nSo, you know, Venezuela is one of these countries that’s not producing as much as it could, right? It has the potential to be producing 2 million-plus more barrels per day. But you know, we’ve seen that they really have just—they went into freefall. So, I think that’s a big issue.\\nAnd another big issue, which—God, it goes back to an earlier question—is that of emissions. So, the oil that comes out of Venezuela is a very, very heavy oil. So, it’s—it has very large carbon emissions associated with the production of that oil. So, that, I think, is—again, as we—you know, think about the emissions from oil production in countries that are sort of seeking to kind of market themselves as low-emission producers, you know, Venezuela definitely will have a very hard time recouping its—where its oil sector was. Again, it has the capacity, it has the reserves. But getting that—getting that oil out of the ground right now, you have a lot of significant above-ground risks.\\nFASKIANOS: Thank you.\\nI’m going to go next to Clemente Abrokwaa. Raised hand, so please unmute yourself.\\nQ: Can you hear me, please?\\nFASKIANOS: Yes, we can.\\nQ: Thank you. Thank you so much for your—for your talk. I was also very shocked about the amount of barrels that we consume every day. (Laughs.) I didn’t know that. But anyway, I’m from Penn State University.\\nAnd my question is: You just mentioned about the above-ground, you know, effects. And—so the movement towards, like, electric vehicles and so on, how do you think it is going to affect the African continent?\\nKISSANE: Thank you.\\nQ: I am—I’m thinking, you know, the economies, and then infrastructure. It will be very difficult for them to—(laughs)—move with the rest of the world in terms of electric vehicles, and so on. I just wanted your take on that.\\nKISSANE: Thank you, Clemente. It’s an excellent question.\\nYeah, I mean, you have countries across the African continent that not only have oil reserves, but are already producing, right? Nigeria is a—is an oil-producing country, also has more capacity, but again, you have some above-ground risks. You also have the need for investment of new infrastructure.\\nI think one of the things that has been very interesting—and I think it’s getting—it’s getting more attention, as it deserves, is how Western governments are—some of—I think a challenge across Africa is that a lot of Western governments have sort of said, listen, we’re not going to invest in fossil fuels—or also, financial institutions, Western financial institutions—we’re not going to invest in fossil fuels, or new projects that are fossil-based.\\nAnd that—you know, that’s problematic when you look across the African continent, where you still don’t have, you know, 100 percent energy access. You know, the idea of the transition to electric vehicles, which is taking a very, very long time, even here across the—across developed economies—so the need for the infusion of more capital to go into, you know, across the continent of Africa for oil and gas, that’s for their economies and for their own economic growth, I think, is really, really pivotal.\\nAnd I think this is something that, you know, is being discussed across multilateral financial institutions. And also, you know, is it hypocrisy, right, for Western banks that have, you know, kind of funded the oil and gas industry, or helped to fund the oil and gas industry in the United States and many different parts of the world, and that are now sort of not allowing those funds to flow to Africa. And they have the—again, they have the—they have the resources. So you know, is it—you know, the equity of some of these decisions that are being made, I think, is one that’s—is one that’s really important.\\nAnd again, I—you know, I said earlier in this talk, is that, you know, all—most of the demand for oil is not coming from North America and from Europe. All of the demand that we’re seeing and new demand that we’re going to see, is coming from Asia, and is going to come from Africa.\\nSo again, you know, how are we going to make sure that that demand is met, again, going back to that idea of energy security, so there is—there is accessibility, so there is reliable sources of energy at affordable prices, you know, without sort of thinking about kind of a whole-of-energy approach.\\nSo, I think it’s very—it’s a very complex issue. And I think, you know, Western banks who have sort of taken very sharp positions on what they will and will not fund, when it comes to new oil and gas projects, are getting sort of challenged as to, you know, what does that mean, then, for, you know, countries across Africa that are still very much in need of more energy, not less. And again, recognizing that, you know, EVs that, again, are still—are—you know, we’re seeing adoption here in the United States and across Europe, but it’s a big, big, big adoption in China. But it’s very uneven. So how do we ensure greater energy security for the continent of Africa, I think, is a really critical question.\\nFASKIANOS: Thank you.\\nI’ll take the next question from Kyle Bales, who is a senior at Lewis University in Romeoville, Illinois: How is the war between Russia and Ukraine having an effect on the progress of the European Green Deal? Maybe you can tell us what the European—define the European Green Deal for us, Carolyn, give us the context for that.\\nKISSANE: Yes, so, again, this is another fantastic question.\\nYeah, the European Green Deal, it’s—this is—this is great. Yeah, I mean, a lot of people would say that the European Green Deal now is—that the—Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has sort of said, hey, this is why the Green Deal is so important. This is why we really need to more quickly transition to renewable energy, because look what—look what happened when we were dependent on Russia for over 30 percent of our natural gas. And look, when Russia, you know, illegally invades Ukraine and suddenly weaponizes gas, we are left very energy-insecure. It affects—it affects consumers. It affects industry across the continent.\\nSo, I think we’re seeing, not just through the Green Deal, but we’re also seeing through, sort of European green industrial policy—so in some ways, akin to what, you know, we put into effect in—this past summer, is the Inflation Reduction Act. And we’re seeing almost, kind of, this industrial competition around clean energy technologies.\\nAnd so, Europe is investing—you know, I think it’s about $250 billion, the United States, it’s about 370 billion—towards the—kind of the energy transition, and helping to support domestic industries and companies to—you know, to be able to, you know, develop the technologies, and to have the, you know, the opportunity to contribute to the energy transition.\\nSo, I think one thing, though—whenever I talk about Europe, it’s really important, is to sort of recognize that, you know, when you look across Europe, you have very different policies and kind of approaches, to sort of thinking about energy, and how quickly some countries want to transition and can transition, whereas others, you know, are probably going to experience a slower transition.\\nSo, just really interesting example, as you talked about the Green Deal, is the EU taxonomy, the green taxonomy, that went into effect in the—January of 2022. And there, you had, like, really a lot of contention between France and Germany, because France wanted to make sure that nuclear was part of the green taxonomy. Germany was opposed, right, but Germany wanted to make sure natural gas was part of the green taxonomy. So ultimately, in the end, both natural gas and nuclear—and again, this was—this predated Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. But in the EU green taxonomy, you have—you know, you have both nuclear and natural gas, in addition to other renewable energies that can make up this taxonomy, that includes specific measures towards adaptation and mitigation for climate change.\\nSo you know, I think you’re seeing this kind of—some people call it a race, a competition. You know, ideally, it’s—you know, we’re kind of working together to—because we’re all sort of going in the same direction—to, you know, support the transition, and to reduce—to reduce carbon emissions, and to bring in more, sort of, cleaner energy technologies into our system.\\nFASKIANOS: Thank you.\\nI’m going to take the next question from Dr. Laeed Zaghlami.\\nQ: Yes, good afternoon. This is Laeed—good afternoon, Irina. Good afternoon, Carolyn. I’m very pleased to be part of your program.\\nJust to—want to be back to Africa and particularly to Nigeria, how practical the two projects that Nigeria is advocating for pipelines, one from—through Algeria, and the other one to Morocco through western African countries? How practical are these pipelines to supply gas to Europe and parts of some African countries?\\nFASKIANOS: And Dr. Zaghlami, you are at Algiers University, correct?\\nQ: Indeed, Irina, yes. I am professor at University of Algiers, faculty of information and communication.\\nFASKIANOS: Thank you.\\nKISSANE: Dr. Laeed, can I—can I keep you on for just one second?\\nCan I ask you, what is the—what is the status right now? Is it—it’s planned, under construction? Where is—what is the status of those two pipelines? My understanding is that it’s—they’re proposed, but—\\nQ: Yes, well, actually in—practically, the pipeline between Algeria and Abuja, which means through Niger and so forth, is already in progress, whereas the other project, through thirteen western African countries, they are supposed to be implemented by 2047. But is it—is there any political game or something of strategic—(inaudible)—how practical, how logical, how efficiently will be for Nigeria to have two similar project(s)?\\nKISSANE: Yeah, no, it’s—again, thank you for the question. You know, pipelines, again, that’s why I wanted to show the—(laughs)—kind of the map of pipelines, is because, you know, a lot of pipelines transverse, you know, multiple countries, right? And this is—this requires not just, you know, a lot of cooperation, but it requires technically. It also can be very complex to build—to build pipelines. And when you’re talking about something like, as you—as you point out, these are, you know, crossing many countries.\\nYou know, I think one of the—again, one of the issues is whether or not—since, you know, what already is under construction, I think you can, you know, with confidence, that one will be completed. Anything that’s not yet under construction—and again, the timeline, 2047, is way out there—a lot of—a lot of uncertainty as to what the status of those projects will be moving forward, for various reasons, in terms of making sure that the investments are there.\\nSomeone I know that studies pipelines, he says, you know, until the steel is in the ground, you don’t have the pipeline, and so until you know that you’ve got that, you know, you’ve got all the OKs, and you feel that kind of security of being able to build it, and being able to provide the resources to supply it and to move it.\\nI think Algeria has been a really interesting case that hasn’t gotten enough attention, in terms of Algerian gas, that has—that has helped support Europe. Over the last years, we’ve seen an increase in Algerian gas going into Europe. Again, a lot of attention on U.S. LNG and the increase of liquefied natural gas exports into Europe, but also Algeria has been, you know, very important for helping to support European energy security, and make up for some of the losses of the—of the Russian gas. And I think we’ll see more attention on Algeria, and Algeria’s role as a—you know, as an important source of energy, especially, you know, gas, going into—going into Europe, moving forward.\\nFASKIANOS: So, I’ll take the next written question from Vincent Brooks, who is at Harvard and Diamondback Energy board of directors: How do you view the purchasing of discounted Russian oil by India, in particular relative to the purchasing by China? How are they using the oil purchased? And are you seeing more internal usage or external profit-making sales in places like Africa? And what are the implications of all of this?\\nKISSANE: Right, great. Great question. So, all of the above—(laughs)—in some ways, right? There is definitely sort of profits that are being made.\\nYou know, I was—I was talking about this last week with someone, and you know, if you sort of put your shoe—put yourself in the shoes of India, right, so, India is a—is a rapidly growing economy, 1.4 billion. You know, if you had—if you have very high energy inflation and high oil prices, that’s going to have ripples effects across the Indian economy. And so, you know, when you have a kind of opportunity to buy, you know, pretty steep discounted oil, which, you know, they had been able to buy from Russia, you know, for purposes of national security, they’ve been buying the oil.\\nAnd one of the things that’s very interesting about India is that, actually, India has been building out its refining capacity. So, a lot of that oil is both for domestic, and some of it is being sort of re-exported. But I think what we’ve seen is that they’re using that oil to also sort of enhance their capacity and capabilities as a rapidly emerging, refining power in Asia.\\nAnd we see that in some ways in China, too. So, China, even though oil demand was down in 2022, much of the oil that they were buying from Russia went into its strategic supplies, which, you know, they now have access to.\\nAnd again, I think, you know, a big question is what we’re going to see moving forward around oil demand in China. Wood Mackenzie just published a really interesting piece, kind of very bullish, on the expectations for oil demand in China, so whether or not they’re going to continue to buy, you know, Russian oil—and again, sort of taking advantage of these lower prices, you know. And I think—I think one of the things that—it’s kind of an inconvenient truth, whereas a lot of this oil trading used to happen in Europe, so European trading houses were kind of the main—the main points of Russian oil trade. A lot of that has been moved out, so, you know, Russia has found ways to kind of bypass some of the sanctions, and have set up—in some cases, they’ve set up trading houses. And some of those trading houses have been sort of set up in places that, you know, that they can sort of, again, bypass the compliance to the sanctions.\\nAnd you have some—you have some Russian oil traders that are making a lot of money—(laughs)—selling discounted oil, and then reselling it.\\nA really interesting case, a couple of months ago, was out of Malaysia. Malaysia announced—or, in the, you know—that they were—that 1.5 million barrels were produced and sold, but only—Malaysia doesn’t produce that much. So, those were Russian barrels that were sort of being sold under, sort of, the Malaysian—under the Malaysian barrel.\\nSo, again, I think China and India have, you know, have taken advantage. Some of this has, again—as I said, has been re-exported. And some of it, you know, has been re-exported through petroleum products, because China and India, you know, both are building and have refining capacity.\\nFASKIANOS: Thank you.\\nI’m going to take the next question from Bhakti Mirchandani at Columbia University: What global trajectory do you see for nuclear? The Russia-Ukraine crisis has taken some of the refining capacity offline, and nuclear has the potential to change the geopolitics of energy. And so what steps can be taken to foster nuclear energy?\\nKISSANE: Bhakti, thank you. And I was just at Columbia earlier today for the Center for Global Energy Policy’s conference.\\nYeah, nuclear is very interesting, right? So when we’re thinking about, you know, decarbonizing our energy systems, you know, nuclear plays a very important role, because it’s zero-emitting. So in certain parts of the world—China being one, Saudi Arabia—you know, you have a lot of new nuclear build. You know, in other parts of the world, you have a lot of contention about nuclear. We saw that even in Germany, which have, you know, three remaining nuclear power plants. And even in the midst of massive energy crisis over the last year, there was still sort of pushback about, no, those nuclear power plants need to be shut down, whereas you would think, OK, in light of energy insecurity, let’s keep them open.\\nSo, you know, France is an interesting country. France had planned to reduce its nuclear capacity by 50 percent. But this past year, they pivoted and they’ve said, no, we’re actually going to build out more nuclear, and we’re sort of—we’re totally scrapping that idea of reducing nuclear energy. And nuclear is very important for France’s electricity system.\\nSweden has also announced that they are going to build new nuclear, and they’re going to increase by, I think, almost 50 percent. Again, part of this is their—to meet their targets of net zero.\\nWe also see Japan. Japan, you know, the Fukushima disaster really turned Japanese—the Japanese public off of nuclear. Very, very deep opposition to restarting the nuclear power plants. But this past year, even though there’s still safety concerns on the part of the public, the public is also very concerned about energy insecurity and higher prices. So, nuclear being a domestic source of energy.\\nSo, I think when you look at, you know, net-zero pathways, I have not seen a net-zero pathway that does not include nuclear. So, here in the United States, the net-zero America project out of Princeton, very important place for nuclear. We just have a really hard time—(laughs)—building nuclear at cost, so it’s very expensive. Usually, it’s significant cost overruns. And of course, there is the—I think they have a really significant PR problem. People—there’s still a lot of concern about the safety of nuclear.\\nSo, I think to your point, it’s very, very important for decarbonizing energy systems, but you’re going to see, I think, very disjointed approaches. Some countries are going—are embracing nuclear, and other countries are sort of doubling down on their opposition, and are not going to allow nuclear to be part of the energy system.\\nFASKIANOS: We have so many questions, and we are just not going to get to them all.\\nSo, I’m going to take the next question from Christian Bonfili, who’s at Torcuato di Tella University in Argentina.\\nSo, do you think, Carolyn, that the landscape resulting from the Ukraine invasion by Russia, vis-à-vis securitization of gas and energy between Europe and Russia, could accelerate energy transition toward greener energy?\\nKISSANE: Great question.\\nI think in Europe, it is. And I think, you know, many analysts would agree that—the IEA, for example—you know, you had the, you know—how does Europe continue—you know, to enhance and achieve energy security without the dependence on Russia gas? And a lot of that is through renewable energy. You also have a lot of new attention on hydrogen, and the role that hydrogen will play.\\nI think—I think Europe is being cautious, and so they are not saying that they are going to completely move away from gas, so as earlier questions, are they getting gas from Algeria, or are they getting gas from Norway? Are they getting more gas from the United States in the form of liquefied natural gas? And then also an uncomfortable truth is they continue to get liquefied natural gas from Russia. So, we’ve seen an increase in LNG from Russia going into Europe.\\nThat said, I think all in, you are seeing that, you know, countries across Europe are saying, OK, you know, how can we enhance our energy security? How do we build more sort of domestic energy sources? Solar, wind, we’re seeing, you know, more rapid deployment. You’ve got a lot of questions about supply chains and things like that, but I think—overall, I think the answer would be that it’s quickening the energy transition.\\nFASKIANOS: So, I will take the moderator prerogative to just ask the final question for you to close on. And just to give us your top three—what are the major challenges for the geopolitics of oil, as you look out over the next five- to ten-year horizon, that you would leave us with, to be looking for?\\nKISSANE: OK. You know, so I think what we saw, right, tensions between Saudi Arabia and the United States. We also have a, you know, a hot war, cold war, depending on, you know, the term you want to use, between the United States and China, and lots of sort of questions as to what that’s going to look like.\\nI think there’s—you know, I think there’s concern that, you know, we’re not reducing demands, but we’re seeing tightening supply. And so that’s going to have, you know, very significant impacts for economies, especially economies that are already very fragile, economically fragile, politically fragile. So that concerns me a lot, in terms of, you know, what happens when, you know, economies don’t have adequate access to energy to make sure that their industries, that their—that consumers, you know, are able—that the lights can stay on, and you can get—you know, if you’re dependent on cars, you’re depending on trucks, like, all these kinds of things are really, really critical.\\nSo, I think we have to be very cautious moving forward, that we don’t take more out of the system before we have adequately set up the system to be resilient, and to be able to sort of meet the energy security demands that are not—are not—they’re not decreasing. I think they are increasing and becoming even more complex.\\nSo, I think there’s a lot of concerns and a lot of uncertainty. And you know, this definitely is going to be an area to watch in the years ahead.\\nFASKIANOS: Carolyn Kissane—Kissane, excuse me—thank you very much for shaping and sharing this discussion, for sharing your terrific insights with us, and to all of you for your questions and comments.

Yesterday, President Donald Trump was walking back his recent criticisms of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, going as far as to say he could not believe that he had called Zelensky a “dictator.” Today, Trump held an acrimonious meeting with Zelensky that culminated in Ukrainian president being asked to leave the White House and a joint press conference being canceled.\\nThe Trump-Zelensky meeting before the press pool spray, which Vice President JD Vance joined, has no precedent. Heads of government generally do not bicker in front of the cameras. But in today’s meeting, Trump accused Zelensky of “gambling with World War III,” said that Ukraine does not “have the cards” to stay in its war with Russia, and insisted that Russian President Vladimir Putin had gone “through a hell of a lot with me” because of accusations the Kremlin sought to help Trump win the 2016 election.\\nMore on:\\nUnited States\\nThe War in Ukraine\\nTrump\\nU.S. Foreign Policy Program\\nNational Security and Defense Program\\nTrump followed up on the meeting with a Truth Social post accusing Zelensky of having “disrespected the United States of America.”\\nBut the post notably also left the door open for Zelensky to get back in Trump’s good graces by saying that Ukraine “is ready for peace.”\\nZelensky certainly has every incentive to heal the spat. Shortly after departing, he tweeted out his peace offering:\\nThose words may, or may not, be enough to placate Trump. Much may turn on whether he and his advisors read Zelensky’s words as sincere—or mocking their demands that he publicly thank the United States for its support.\\nSo where do things go from here? The honest answer is that no one but Trump knows—and even he may not. Today’s outburst may have been spontaneous, or it may have been calculated. Trump’s chaotic and disruptive negotiating style, combined with his taste for performative acts meant to thrill his MAGA base and intimidate opponents, means either motivation is possible.\\nMore on:\\nUnited States\\nThe War in Ukraine\\nTrump\\nU.S. Foreign Policy Program\\nNational Security and Defense Program\\nThe Water's Edge\\nJames M.

Although he said in December that he might reduce U.S. military aid to Ukraine once in office, that has yet to happen. Ukraine’s ability to hold off Russia depends on maintaining the flow of U.S. weapons. Everything changes if that stops. Europe cannot make up the shortfall. So while the rhetorical fireworks between Trump (and Vance) and Zelensky grab the headlines—Trump himself said that today’s meeting made for “great television”—deeds matter more than words.\\nTrump no doubt believes that he came out of today’s exchange with Zelensky as the winner. But he may have complicated his effort to negotiate an end to the war in Ukraine. It has always been doubtful that Russian President Vladimir Putin will agree to any terms other than the ones he dictates. Those include, among other things , that Ukraine concede territory beyond what Russia has already taken. Trump’s rebuke of Zelensky only encourages Putin belief that he will get what he wants if he stands firm. So Trump’s public spat with Zelensky hardly seems consistent with the art of the deal.\\nTrump could, of course, follow through on his implied threat today and wash his hands of Ukraine. But that entails big political risks for his presidency. Trump may think well of Putin, but most Americans do not . Leaving Ukrainians to the mercy of Russian forces could damage Trump as much as the botched withdrawal from Afghanistan hurt President Joe Biden.\\nWhat is clear from today’s meeting is that U.S. foreign policy under Trump will not follow the path that it has for the past eighty years, as if that point needed to be proved again. The forty-seventh president remains more focused on the alleged shortcomings of America’s friends than on standing up to a predatory power that threatens U.S. interests. That is a recipe for a more dangerous world .\\nOscar Berry assisted in the preparation of this post .\\nCreative Commons\\nCreative Commons: Some rights reserved.\\nClose\\nThis work is licensed under Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0) License.\\nView License Detail\\nClose\\nExplore More\\nPost\\nThe President’s Inbox Recap: Trump’s Peace Plan for Ukraine\\nPost\\nThe President’s Inbox Recap: The Future of U.S. Foreign Policy\\nBackgrounder\\nFunding the United Nations: How Much Does the U.S. Pay?\\nCouncil on Foreign Relations\\nAbout\\nMember Programs\\nContact\\nSupport\\nFor Media\\nNewsletters\\nMembership\\nCareers\\n©2025 Council on Foreign Relations.\\nAll rights reserved.\\nPrivacy Policy and\\nTerms of Use .\\n\"}, {'title': 'European leaders back Zelensky after Trump clash | BBC News', 'source': 'youtube.com', 'date': '2025-03-01T20:35:28Z', 'url': 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wp2d7PNECOc', 'snippet': 'Comments18K · Watch in full as Zelensky and Trump clash in fiery Oval Office exchange | BBC News · Forceful Ukrainian and global reactions one day ...', 'content': 'European leaders back Zelensky after Trump clash | BBC News - YouTube About Press Copyright Contact us Creators Advertise Developers Terms Privacy Policy & Safety How YouTube works Test new features NFL Sunday Ticket © 2025 Google LLC'}, {'title': 'Watch in full as Zelensky and Trump clash in fiery Oval Office ...', 'source': 'youtube.com', 'date': '2025-03-01T20:35:28Z', 'url': 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4zYCOVtXg', 'snippet': 'US President Donald Trump and Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky clashed in a fiery exchange on Friday.

U.S. President Donald Trump meets with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the White House in Washington, D.C., U.S., Feb. 28, 2025. Brian Snyder | Reuters President Donald Trump found the tone and body language of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenksyy objectionable during an Oval Office meeting that exploded into a loud argument on Friday, the White House told CNBC. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said there was not a specific thing that Zelenskyy said in the Oval Office to Trump or Vice President JD Vance that the president objected to, but the tone and manner in which he said it. Leavitt said Friday that Zelenskyy — whose country was invaded three years ago by Russia at the direction of its president, Vladimir Putin — was folding his arms, rolling his eyes and sitting in a way that indicated a lack of respect. Leavitt also pointed out that Zelenskyy called Vance \"JD,\" instead of \"Mr. Vice President,\" during the fiery exchange, which was televised in front of reporters in the Oval Office.

Trump Media sues Brazil Supreme Court justice who once crossed Musk The clash occurred when Zelenskyy challenged the idea that Russia could be trusted to honor the terms of any peace deal that would be reached through diplomacy. Vance then accused the Ukrainian leader of being \"disrespectful\" by \"trying to litigate\" the terms of such a deal in the Oval Office. Press secretary Leavitt said that White House officials were also annoyed that Zelenskyy did not wear a suit during his visit Friday, which abruptly ended with a scheduled news conference and meal both canceled after the Oval Office blow-up. When CNBC noted that the White House did not appear to have a problem with top Trump advisor Elon Musk recently appearing in the Oval Office next to the president wearing a t-shirt and a baseball cap, Leavitt said that was different because the billionaire Tesla CEO is not the leader of a \"sovereign nation.\" Elon Musk and President Donald Trump in the Oval Office at the White House, Feb. 11, 2025.

Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia — asked Zelenskyy, \"Why don\\'t you wear a suit?\" \"You\\'re at the highest level in this country\\'s office, and you refuse to wear a suit,\" Glenn pressed. \"Do you own a suit?\" Zelenskyy, who was dressed in a black sweater bearing the national symbol of Ukraine, shot back: \"I will wear a suit after this war is over.\" \"Maybe something like yours,\" Zelenskyy told Glenn. \"Maybe better.\" watch now VIDEO 3:05 03:05 Trump: Zelenskyy disrespected the U.S., can come back when he is ready for peace Power Lunch During the Oval Office meeting, Vice President Vance argued that Zelenskyy should \"thank\" Trump for the aid the U.S. has given Ukraine to defend itself against Russia. Zelenskyy responded that he had expressed thanks \"a lot of times. Even today.\" Trump, at one point, defended Russia\\'s Putin againsr Zelenskyy, saying, \"\\u200aPutin went through a hell of a lot with me.\" \"He went through a phony witch hunt where they used him and Russia, Russia, Russia, Russia. You ever hear of that deal?\" Trump asked, referring to the wide-ranging investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. Trump was impeached in 2019 by the U.S. House of Representatives on charges of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress over a July 2019 phone call to Zelenskyy in which he pressured the Ukrainian president to open an investigation into the business dealings of Hunter Biden and his father, former President Joe Biden , who at the time had emerged as a key rival to Trump\\'s chances of winning re-election in 2020. Trump also had conditioned the release of nearly $400 million in U.S. military and security aid to Ukraine on Zelenskky publicly announcing a probe into the Bidens and another probe into \"a discredited theory promoted by Russia alleging that Ukraine — rather than Russia — interfered in the 2016 president election,\" according to the articles of impeachment.

By Katie Herchenroeder March 1, 2025 US President Donald Trump (C) and Vice President JD Vance meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in the Oval Office at the White House on February 28, 2025 in Washington, DC. Andrew Harnik/Getty Images Save this story Save Save this story Save From the moment Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky walked toward President Donald Trump outside of the White House on Friday, the mood was tense . After a brief “How are you,” Trump immediately commented on what Zelensky, who was donning black pants and a matching military shirt, was wearing. “Oh, you’re all dressed up,” Trump said sarcastically as the two leaders shook hands. Whatever cordialness the pair had previously maintained quickly devolved over the next couple of hours in an Oval Office meeting that further strained relations between Trump and Vice President JD Vance and Zelensky into further disarray. The government heads, along with some foreign policy staffers and reporters, were meeting to discuss a new agreement on rare earth minerals. Upstairs in the East Room, the White House staff had set up a long wooden table for the leaders to sign—but they never got there. US President Donald Trump and Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky listen to Vice President JD Vance (R) as they meet in the Oval Office of the White House in Washington, DC on Feb. 28, 2025.\\nSAUL LOEB/Getty Images The beginning of the end happened when, around 40 minutes into the conversation, Vance, who hadn’t spoken much until then, began to defend his boss’ handling of Russia’s ongoing war in Ukraine. “The path to peace and the path to prosperity is maybe engaging in diplomacy,” the vice president said toward Zelensky. In a frustrated response, Zelensky outlined the ceasefires Russia had broken in the past, going back a decade. “What kind of diplomacy, JD, you are speaking about?” he asked. “I’m talking about the kind of diplomacy that’s going to end the destruction of your country,” Vance said back, sitting on a sofa with Trump to his right in a chair. “I think it’s disrespectful for you to come into the Oval Office to try to litigate this in front of the American media,” he continued, one of multiple times he gestured to reporters in the room. The group of pool reporters in the Oval Office was hand-picked by the Trump administration, their latest move in restricting which media outlets have close access to the president. “You should be thanking the president,” Vance said. The vice president and Zelensky continued their back and forth before Trump interjected—leading to an increasingly loud overlapping of voices in the Oval Office as people reportedly watched on in disbelief. “You don’t have the cards right now, with us you start having cards” Trump said, chastising the Ukrainian president for not being more thankful to the United States, and him personally, for sending aid. “I’m not playing cards,” Zelensky responded. “I’m a president in war.” Vance then went in again, also accusing Zelensky of not being thankful enough. “Please, you think if you will speak very loudly about the war—” Zelensky began, before Trump cut him off, saying, “he’s not speaking loudly.” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky speaks during an interview with Fox News Chief Political Anchor Bret Baier on Special Report With Bret Baier at the Fox News studios on February 28, 2025 in Washington, DC.\\nWin McNamee/Getty Images What came next sounded more like one of Trump’s rallies on the campaign trail and less like a meeting to mitigate any future harm in a war that has already killed or wounded roughly one million Russians and Ukrainians. At one point, a journalist asked what would happen if Russian President Vladimir Putin broke a ceasefire deal agreed upon by Russia, Ukraine, and the United States. “What if anything, what if a bomb drops on your head right now,” Trump responded. In another moment, Trump began rambling about a Hunter Biden - Joe Biden - Hillary Clinton - Adam Schiff “witch hunt” and “scam” against himself and Putin as Zelensky listened on, visibly confused and furrowing his brow. In addition to reprimanding Zelensky for not being thankful or “nice” enough, the president also claimed he wasn’t a “tough guy,” a charge that uniquely highlighted Friday’s show of masculinity by Trump and Vance. “The problem is,” Trump began, “I’ve empowered you to be a tough guy, and I don’t think you’d be a tough guy without the United States.” “And your people are very brave,” he said. Zelensky agreed to that part. “But,” Trump continued, “you’re either going to make a deal or we’re out, and if we’re out, you’ll fight it out. I don’t think it’s going to be pretty.” US President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky meet in the Oval Office at the White House on February 28, 2025 in Washington, DC.\\nAndrew Harnik/Getty Images The meeting on Friday comes after Trump previously called Zelensky a dictator, and the Ukrainian president claimed that Trump is living in a Russian “disinformation bubble.” (When Trump was asked later about referring to Zelensky as a “dictator,” he said, “Did I say that? I can’t believe I said that.) After the men eventually left the conversation, with no agreement signed and relations tenser than before, Trump unilaterally decided that Zelensky was “not in a place to negotiate,” according to a White House official, and directed Secretary of State Marco Rubio and national security adviser Mike Waltz to deliver a message to the Ukrainians in the White House: It was time for Zelensky to leave. In the hours following, leaders from across Europe defended Zelensky, with French President Emmanuel Macron distinguishing between who he called the “aggressor,” Russia, and the “victim, Ukraine. Many Republican leaders, meanwhile, rallied behind Trump. Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina—who has been one of the most vocal Republicans in support of Ukraine and who posed for a picture with Zelensky and fellow congress members before the Oval Office meeting—quickly changed his tune, telling reporters later on Friday, “I have never been more proud of the president. I was very proud of J.D. Vance standing up for our country.” X content This content can also be viewed on the site it originates from. Later on Friday, Zelensky spoke with Fox News’ Bret Baier , thanking Trump, Congress, and the American people for aiding Ukraine’s efforts against Russia. “You helped us a lot. From the very beginning, during three years of full-scale invasion, you helped us to survive,” he said. “We are thankful and sorry for this,” Zelensky continued, mentioning the meeting, “I mean this, we wanted very much to have strong relations.” He stopped short, though, of saying sorry directly to Trump when Baier asked him if he owed Trump an apology. When Baier asked if Zelensky believed that his relationship with Trump could be salvaged, the Ukrainian leader responded, “Yes, of course.” According to CNN , Trump watched the interview on his presidential aircraft.

Saul Loeb—Getty Images By Simon Shuster/Kyiv March 1, 2025 8:59 AM EST I t was evening in Kyiv when the news from the White House arrived. My dinner mate, a colonel in the Ukrainian armed forces, got a call on his phone while raising a toast, and I could hear a muffled voice urging him to watch the footage from the Oval Office. We pulled it up on the colonel’s phone and sat there, slack jawed, the fat coagulating on our plates, as my President and his President went at each other like a pair of feuding in-laws. A long moment passed before my companion rendered his verdict. Molodets, he said of President Volodymyr Zelensky. “Well done.” I had rarely heard the officer praise his commander-in-chief. But he seemed genuinely impressed. “He pushed back,\" he said of Zelensky. \"You have to respect that.” Then he paused again, looking down at the screen, and added: “But now we’re f---ed.” Since the drama erupted on Friday, the reactions in Kyiv have mostly swung between these two emotions: pride in their leader for standing up to the most powerful man in the world, and fear of what the consequences would be for Ukraine, for its military and for its chances of surviving Russia’s invasion, which entered its fourth year last week. Among Zelensky’s aides and allies, no one seemed all that surprised by what he said to President Donald Trump, nor by the tone Zelensky took. In many ways, it was classic Zelensky—proud, stubborn, courageous to the point of recklessness, and rarely capable of bearing an insult in silence. “What else was he supposed to do,” one of Zelensky’s advisers asked me on Friday night. “If somebody is wiping their feet on you, are you just supposed to take it?” As we spoke, the adviser kept his eyes fixed on his social media feed, where every Ukrainian with an internet connection seemed to be venting and interpreting what had happened to their leader. Plenty of them were livid with Zelensky. His clash with Trump threatens to rupture an alliance that has kept Ukraine alive during the war with an estimated $183 billion in financial and military aid and critical wartime intelligence that no other ally can replace. With the stakes that high, Zelensky’s political opponents and many independent analysts called Friday’s argument in the Oval Office a diplomatic catastrophe, unprecedented and inexcusable. But those closest to Zelensky knew the outburst had plenty of precedents—except, in the past, they played out behind closed doors. President Joe Biden had similar clashes with Zelensky early in the war. In the summer of 2022, the U.S. agreed to provide a massive package of military aid to Ukraine, including an advanced missile system that Biden withheld for months out of fear of drawing the U.S. deeper into the war. During a phone call to talk about the aid package, which was worth about a billion dollars, Zelensky took barely a minute to thank Biden before he began asking for more assistance. Biden lost his temper in response, chastising the Ukrainian leader for seeming ungrateful. About a year later, Zelensky received a similar dressing down from Ben Wallace, who was then the British Defense Minister. “People want to see gratitude,” Wallace said at a NATO summit in July 2023. “We’re not Amazon.” The U.K. had delivered so many de-mining vehicles to the Ukrainians, Wallace added, “that I think there’s none left.” After the spat, Wallace received so much blowback for his remarks that he issued an apology to Zelensky.\\xa0 On Friday night, it was Zelensky who faced pressure to apologize to Trump during an interview with Fox News, and he declined to offer one. “No. I respect [the] President, and I respect American people,” he said calmly. “I think we have to be very open and very honest, and I’m not sure that we did something bad.” To many Ukrainians, Zelensky was right. In the Oval Office and on Fox News, he spoke with all the conviction and self-respect that his citizens have come to expect from their leader. He has long internalized their collective pain and anger at the Russian invasion, and he has made an art of channeling those emotions as he seeks to win the support of the world. Maybe this time he chose the wrong setting to speak so freely with such a crucial ally. But the main response among my friends in Kyiv was pride in\\xa0having a leader with such a backbone.\\xa0“Every time he goes abroad, he carries with him what we feel here,” one of them told me on\\xa0Friday night. “That’s part of his job. To express those feelings to the world.”\\xa0 More Must-Reads from TIME Inside Elon Musk’s War on Washington Meet the 2025 Women of the Year The Harsh Truth About Disability Inclusion Why Do More Young Adults Have Cancer?\\xa0 Colman Domingo Leads With Radical Love How to Get Better at Doing Things Alone Cecily Strong on Goober the Clown Column: The Rise of America’s Broligarchy Contact us at letters@time.com Edit Post Home U.S. Politics World Health Business Tech Personal Finance by TIME Stamped Shopping by TIME Stamped Future of Work by Charter Entertainment Ideas Science History Sports Magazine The TIME Vault TIME For Kids TIMECO2 Coupons TIME Edge Video Masthead Newsletters Subscribe Digital Magazine Give a Gift Shop the TIME Store Careers Modern Slavery Statement Press Room TIME Studios U.S. & Canada Customer Care Global Help Center Contact the Editors Reprints and Permissions Site Map Media Kit Supplied Partner Content About Us © 2024 TIME USA, LLC.

Get more news Live on Save with a NBCUniversal Profile Create your free profile or log in to save this article By Dan De Luce An ugly and unprecedented confrontation in the Oval Office hammered home President Donald Trump’s hostility toward Ukraine and its president, along with his persistent affinity for Russia’s autocratic ruler. As television cameras rolled, Trump and Vice President JD Vance berated Volodymyr Zelenskyy, the democratically elected leader of a country that has been under attack from Russia since 2014, saying he’s “ungrateful,” “disrespectful” and “gambling with millions of lives.” The lecture left no doubt that Trump sees Ukraine merely as one of the parties in a negotiation, and not as a democratic U.S. ally grappling with the invading force of a much larger, autocratic neighbor, Russia. It also seemed to illustrate Trump’s lopsided\\xa0negotiating tactics, demanding\\xa0the weaker side — Kyiv\\xa0—\\xa0make concessions instead of trying to pressure Moscow into a compromise. The extraordinary scene left Ukraine’s ambassador to the United States, Oksana Markarova, who was in the room, holding her head in her hands — an image that went viral. Previous American presidents have had plenty of tense exchanges with allies, but often in private and never like this. What made this one different was not just that it unfolded with cameras rolling, but that it featured an American president siding with an autocratic and longtime adversary, Russia, against a nascent democracy that has struggled for years to break away from Moscow’s orbit and join the NATO alliance of Western democracies. For decades, presidents from both parties embraced the idea that backing democratic countries served America’s interests and reflected its values. U.S. foreign policy viewed democratic states as better allies and better trading partners, helping to promote stability and the free flow of commerce. But Trump, along with the Republican Party he has transformed, appears to have rejected that decades-old American consensus. For Trump, Russia is apparently a powerful country that the U.S. can cut a deal with, and Ukraine is a less powerful country that does not necessarily have a seat at the table or a sympathetic ear at the White House. Democracy doesn’t seem to figure in this president’s equation. Zelenskyy and Trump openly clashed in the White House, where they were due to sign a deal on sharing Ukraine’s mineral riches and discuss a peace deal with Russia. SAUL LOEB / AFP - Getty Images Partisan gulf After the tense exchange was broadcast, Republicans in Congress almost uniformly praised Trump for attacking Ukraine’s leader. “Thank you for standing up for OUR COUNTRY and putting America first, President Trump and Vice President Vance!” Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, posted on X . Sen. Jim Banks, R-Ind., suggested that the Ukrainian leader was spoiled. “Zelensky ungratefully expects us to bankroll and escalate another forever war—all while disrespecting the President,” he said in a statement.\\xa0“The entitlement is insulting to working Americans.” A handful of Republicans blamed Putin for the conflict. “Some want to whitewash the truth, but we cannot ignore the truth. Russia is at fault for this war,” said Rep. Don Bacon , R-Neb. Democratic lawmakers called Trump’s conduct a betrayal of democracy and an ally. Sen. Jack Reed of Rhode Island, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Armed Services Committee, condemned Trump’s treatment of Zelenskyy as a “political ambush” that played into the hands of Putin. “President Zelenskyy and the people of Ukraine are fighting for their very lives and existence,” Reed said in a statement.\\xa0“To mock Ukraine and our allies is a travesty that only benefits Putin.” Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont lambasted Trump in a post on X . “Sorry, President Trump. We believe in democracy, not authoritarianism.” House Democratic Whip Katherine Clark of Massachusetts said, “I never thought an American President would choose a Russian dictator over a democratic ally.” Across Europe, political leaders declared staunch support for Zelenskyy and his country, pledging to stand by Ukraine — without mentioning Trump. French President Emmanuel Macron said, “There is an aggressor: Russia. There is a victim: Ukraine. ... They are fighting for their dignity, their independence, their children, and the security of Europe.” Friedrich Merz,\\xa0Germany’s likely next chancellor based on the country’s recent election results, said, “We must never confuse aggressor and victim in this terrible war.” Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European Commission, praised Zelenskyy in a post on X . “Your dignity honors the bravery of the Ukrainian people. Be strong, be brave, be fearless. You are never alone,” she wrote. “We will continue working with you for a just and lasting peace.” President Donald Trump and Vice President JD Vance meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Andrew Harnik / Getty Images Trusting Putin or Zelenskyy The meeting in the Oval Office started routinely enough, with Trump saying it was “an honor” to have Zelenskyy at the White House and the two would sign an agreement that would grant the U.S. a share in Ukraine’s mineral wealth. But the divide between the two leaders became clear when reporters asked about the details of a possible ceasefire and if the U.S. was prepared to provide security guarantees to Ukraine. Trump dismissed the idea as irrelevant. “I don’t want to talk about security yet, because I want to get the deal done,” Trump said. “Security is so easy, that’s about 2% of the problem. I’m not worried about security. I’m worried about getting the deal done.” For months, Zelenskyy has argued that any ceasefire or peace agreement has to include security commitments from European countries and the U.S. to help arm and protect Ukraine from further aggression from Russia. European leaders have endorsed Zelenskyy’s stance, and France and the United Kingdom have indicated they would be ready to send troops to back up a peace accord. Putin’s track record in negotiating peace deals has not reassured the Ukrainians. During the meeting, Zelenskyy recounted how Russia had violated a previous ceasefire earlier in the war, before Moscow’s full-scale invasion in 2022. “That’s why we will never accept just [a] ceasefire,” he said. The fireworks erupted when Vance said former President Joe Biden had only offered empty threats and that it was time to pursue diplomacy. Zelenskyy, appearing exasperated, asked Vance “what kind of diplomacy” he was referring to. The Ukrainian president recounted how Russia’s military onslaught against Ukraine had begun more than 10 years ago in the Crimean Peninsula and in the country’s east, that the world had failed to stop Russia and that diplomacy had failed.\\xa0Putin, he argued, could not be trusted. Vance shot back: “Mr. President, with respect. I think it’s disrespectful for you to come to the Oval Office to try to litigate this in front of the American media.” As Zelenskyy tried to respond, Trump berated him. “What you’re doing is very disrespectful to the country, this country that’s backed you far more than a lot of people say they should have.” Zelenskyy warned Trump and Vance that without Ukraine holding Russia back, Putin would eventually strike at NATO’s eastern flank in the Baltics and Poland, possibly pulling America into a conflict. A White House official told NBC News that Zelenskyy was subsequently asked to leave. After his departure, Trump posted online, “He can come back when he is ready for Peace.” In an interview with Fox News later in the day, Zelenskyy said the public quarrel at the White House was “not good” for either side. And he said Ukrainians “just want to hear that America is on our side and that America will stay with us, not with Russians.” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy leaves the White House on Friday. Andrew Harnik / Getty Images Trump’s perception of Ukraine Before the Oval Office confrontation, Trump was asked by a reporter if he was on Ukraine’s side in proposed peace negotiations with Russia or if he saw himself as a mediator “in the middle.” Trump said he was “in the middle,” trying to bring an end to the war. But Trump’s harsh words for Ukraine in the Oval Office, his recent comments that Kyiv “started the war” and that Zelenskyy is a “dictator” suggested he is more inclined to Russia’s point of view. Trump expressed sympathy for the Russian autocrat. He said he and Putin had both been victims of what he has described as false allegations surrounding the 2016 election. U.S. intelligence officials and a Senate report concluded Russia tried to influence the outcome of that election in Trump’s favor and that Moscow operatives reached out to the Trump campaign. “He had to suffer through the Russia hoax,” Trump said. In Moscow, Zelenskyy’s rough reception at the White House was greeted with delight. Dmitry Medvedev, Russia’s former president and the deputy chair of the country’s security council, lauded Trump for telling Zelenskyy “the truth to his face for the first time” and agreed with the American president that Ukraine could ignite World War III. Medvedev described Zelenskyy as “an ungrateful pig” who “got a solid slap from the pigsty owners.” Dan De Luce Dan De Luce\\xa0is a reporter for the NBC News Investigative Unit.\\xa0 About Contact Help Careers Ad Choices Privacy Policy Your Privacy Choices CA Notice Terms of Service (Updated JULY 7, 2023) NBC News Sitemap Closed Captioning Advertise Select Shopping ©\\xa02025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC NBC News Logo MSNBC Logo Today Logo\"},\n",

A planned appearance by President Zelensky at a think tank earlier this evening was cancelled at the last minute – after the buffet had already been served. Ukrainian officials are still trying to process what happened today. But there’s no doubt in government circles that this trip has gone terribly wrong. A day that was meant to bring about a new chapter in US-Ukraine relations has ended with the two sides in uncharted territory. US support has proven critical for Ukraine’s survival – President Zelensky said as much on Fox News this evening. He heads to London on Saturday to meet UK prime minister Sir Keir Starmer, an important ally. But Kyiv will be thinking hard about how to salvage damaged relations with their most important partner - the United States.

It was Donald Trump.” Senator Tammy Duckworth, a combat veteran : \"Attacking our democratic partner in service of an autocratic dictator.\\nTrump is a national disgrace.\" Representative Ted Lieu, a long-serving member of the House who sits on the Foreign Affairs Committee: \"Nobody is celebrating President Trump and Vice President Vance’s embarrassing behavior in the Oval Office more than Vladimir Putin.

The wardrobe question presaged the argument about thankfulness and respect. \"Why don\\'t\\nyou wear a suit? Do you own a suit? A lot of Americans have a problem with you\\nnot respecting the dignity of the office,\" the reporter asked. Zelensky has made a habit of wearing sweatshirts, usually\\nadorned with the Ukrainian trident symbol, even when at important meetings with\\nworld leaders. He seemed unperturbed by the question. \"I will wear (a) costume after this war will finish,”\\nhe told the reporter. “Maybe something like yours, maybe something better…\\nMaybe something cheaper.\" The question was posed by Brian Glenn, the Chief White House\\nCorrespondent for Real America’s Voice, a right-wing network with a show line-up\\nchock-full of Trump allies. It’s unclear how salty the Ukrainian president meant to be in\\nhis answer - the word “suit” can be translated into Ukrainian as “kostyum” - and\\nthe news conference swiftly moved on. But the issue of due respect was at the centre of the full-fledged\\nargument that burst out in the Oval Office just minutes later.

Meanwhile, Trump\\'s administration have made repeated remarks about annexing the US\\' northern neighbour, with the president referring to the Canada\\'s prime minister as \"Governor Trudeau\" and Canada as the \"51st state\" on multiple occasions. Canada has the world\\'s second-largest Ukrainian diaspora, following only Russia.

Welcome to the final session of the Winter/Spring 2023 CFR Academic Webinar Series. I’m Irina Faskianos, vice president of the National Program and Outreach here at CFR.\\nToday’s discussion is on the record. And the video and transcript will be available on our website, CFR.org/Academic, if you would like to share these materials with your colleagues or classmates. As always, CFR takes no institutional positions on matters of policy.\\nWe are delighted to have Carolyn Kissane with us to discuss the geopolitics of oil. Dr. Kissane is the academic director of both the graduate program in global affairs and the graduate program in global security conflict and cybercrime at NYU’s Center for Global Affairs, where she is also a clinical professor. She also serves as director of the energy, climate justice, and sustainability lab in the School of Professional Studies at NYU. She was named in 2013 by Breaking Energy as one of the top ten New York women in energy, and top ten energy communicator. She’s a member of the Council on Foreign Relations and the National Committee on U.S.-China Relations, and serves on several boards.\\nSo, Carolyn, thanks very much for doing this. We really appreciate it.\\nI thought we could begin by talking about how has the geopolitics of oil changed, especially vis-à-vis Russia’s war in Ukraine and OPEC’s recent announcement to cut oil production?\\nKISSANE: Well, first of all, I’d just like to say, thank you so very much for having me. I’m really delighted. I am a big fan of CFR’s Academic Webinars. So, to have the opportunity to participate in this—in this way is very meaningful to me. So, thank you.\\nSo, wow. There is so much happening in this space, the geopolitics of oil. This has been a tremendous fourteen months. Russia’s reinvasion of Ukraine very much upended the geopolitics of oil because Russia is a significant producer, one of the top three in the world.\\nAnd it’s—you know, it’s caused a kind of a reshaping, a kind of a remapping of the—of oil geopolitics. And we’ve seen some, you know, shifts in how countries think about oil security, in light of larger questions about broader energy security questions. And also, on top of that, is the ongoing energy transition, coupled with, you know, climate change, and the need to decarbonize.\\nSo, there’s just—it’s been quite a—you know, a year and a half, that has really sort of put energy security, and oil security, very much at the forefront of people’s minds.\\nFASKIANOS: Fantastic.\\nI thought maybe you had some really interesting data to show us. And if you could walk us through those—the trends you are seeing and really bring it to life, that would be fantastic.\\nKISSANE: Sure.\\nSo, before I do—I have a couple of slides. And before I share my slides, I think it’s really important that, sort of, we understand how interconnected, sort of, the global energy system is, and how interconnected we are, when it comes to the flows of oil.\\nYou know, some countries are very well resourced-endowed, so they have oil. And other countries do not, so they need to import oil. There’s really no country in the world that doesn’t need oil for larger national security issues. And I think one of things that many people sort of are not necessarily aware of or think about, is the amount of oil that gets produced every day.\\nSo, every day, the world consumes over 100 million barrels a day. And every day, that 100 million barrels has to be—has to be moved. It has to be—you know, as part of getting it into the system, getting it to its respective destinations. And what we’re not seeing—which, maybe some people may have thought that we would see at this point—is we’re not seeing a reduction in demand, but we’re seeing an expansion in demand. And much of that global demand is coming out of Asia. And we’re also, of course, seeing the—with the reopening of China, lots of really interesting questions as to what oil demand will be in China for the 2023-2024 years, whether or not they will—they will, sort of, put extra pressure on global demand.\\nAnd you know, Irina, just also, you know, it’s—I’m going to share this in my slides. But you know, last week’s decision from OPEC+ to reduce production, of course, had an impact on the price of oil. So when the decision was announced on Sunday, by Monday morning, we saw an uptick in the price. It’s stabilized, but we are sort of looking at $80-plus-a-barrel oil. And again, lots of uncertainty as to what that’s going to mean across economies that are in recessions, experiencing sort of the beginnings of a recession, and sort of what does it mean for the global economy, where we may see sort of more energy inflation.\\nSo, one of the things that I really like to do when I teach the geopolitics of oil is sort of show some visuals. Because I think, again, sort of, really reinforcing the interconnected nature of our global energy system, but also sort of seeing where in the world is oil produced, and where in the world are the—are the importers. And also, just a couple of sort of fun pieces on what we have seen, just this—you know, in the last week, of course, some of this—you’ll be familiar with, those in the audience—but this decision on the part of OPEC to reduce production by 1.2 million barrels a day—again, happening at a time, not when we have an excess supply, but when we’re seeing a tight supply across the oil market. So, it came as a bit of a surprise to—you know—to even the most, you know, longstanding analysts and OPEC observers.\\nAnd again, part of this is directed probably toward self-interests on the part of Saudi Arabia and the oil producers that are really going to make the cuts. But of course, it also has an impact here for those of you that are sitting in the United States. What does it mean then for prices that Americans pay at the gas pump? So, the Biden administration sort of came out after this decision was made in sort of being disappointed, surprised that OPEC would make this decision.\\nNow, it’s also important to sort of recognize that this is not just a singular OPEC decision. This is part of, now, a larger OPEC+. And OPEC+ does also include Russia, as well as other countries like Kazakhstan and Mexico. So, the OPEC that we have historically known is now different, because you have other countries that are not official members but nonetheless are part of what we now refer to as OPEC+.\\nAnd these are the countries that are part of OPEC, and really the country that’s considered to be sort of in the driver’s seat of OPEC is that of Saudi Arabia, because Saudi Arabia is the largest producer within the OPEC organization, producing anywhere from 10 to 11 million barrels a day. Venezuela has the largest reserves, but it is far from being at capacity, in terms of what it can—what it can produce. So, just to kind of put that into perspective, these are OPEC countries and their respective reserves.\\nAnd then non-OPEC—the United States being a non-OPEC country, but again, this sort of—this chart to the right shows, you know, again, the world is consuming a little over 100 million barrels a day, expected to increase over 2023 and into 2024, question marks as to when we may see peak oil demand.\\nBut again, to sort of link this to energy security—energy security, especially when it’s in the context of oil security—is making sure that we have adequate supply at affordable prices. So, when we see a reduction in supply at a time of tight markets, that suggests that we’re also going to see higher prices that’s going to directly hit vulnerable economies.\\nAnd so, again, just to sort of point out sort of where in the world sort of are the top three oil producers: the United States, Saudi Arabia, and Russia. Russia remains in the top three. Canada as well, our, you know, neighbor to the north. And China is also a producer of oil. The United States figure here also includes gas liquefied, so liquid petroleum, which the United States is endowed with a lot of both oil and natural gas.\\nAnd then the top oil consuming countries, you have U.S., China, and India. Now, the United States is not the largest importer. That position is now held by China. But as far as consumption goes, we consume over 20 million barrels a day. Again, big question mark about China, in terms of whether or not we will see higher demand coming out of China over the next year, two years, with China’s reopening and what is being, you know, discussed as revenge tourism. And more Chinese who have accumulated a lot of savings, 2.1 trillion, how are they going to use that savings and whether or not, after three years of being under lockdown restrictions, whether or not we’ll see impacts to demand.\\nAnd I think Russia is—there’s lots of questions about Russia. And this is now—we’re fourteen months into, you know, Russia’s reinvasion of Ukraine—and I emphasize reinvasion, because oftentimes, we forget that, you know, Russia invaded Ukraine in 2014. But Russia is still moving its oil. And up until, you know, a few months ago, its overall production and exports were as high—at some points, even higher—than pre-invasion. Now, you have new countries that are takers of Russian oil, and they’re buying it at discounted prices. We see Turkey, Singapore, China has been a big buyer, as well as India, that they have been buying discounted Russian oil. Lots of interesting questions that we could discuss about the oil price cap and seaborne embargo to Europe. But I think the takeaway from this slide is that Russia continues to produce oil, continues to sell it, selling at a discounted price, but there are still many countries in the world that are eager to take Russian oil.\\nAnd again, I’m not going to go into this, but I just love this slide, to just emphasize the—you know, the world’s pipelines. These are the pipelines that help sort of the transit of oil. Something also that’s really unique and interesting to look at is just tanker traffic, so, the tankers that carry oil around the world. But again, you know, there are a lot of pipelines, so twenty-three—two thousand, three hundred, and eighty-one operational oil and gas pipelines. Again, these are—it’s moving a lot of the oil that is consumed every day.\\nAnd then finally, is this—is—you know, one of the things that we oftentimes—we think about the hundred million barrels a day that the world is consuming, over 75 percent of the world’s oil is controlled, managed by state-owned oil companies. So, Saudi Aramco being one, PDVSA of Venezuela being another. But it’s really important to sort of recognize the position that state-owned companies have. The rest is controlled or managed by international oil companies—ExxonMobil, Chevron, ENI, Total, and a host of other—host of other companies.\\nBut again, I think the—you know, to understand that NOCs, as they’re referred to, are very, very important for understanding their role in the larger context of the geopolitics of oil.\\nAnd again, what we saw last week coming out of OPEC, this decision, this is also being driven by state budget concerns. This is—again, it’s about the production of oil, but it’s also about, you know, governments and their budgets. And oftentimes, you know, there is a desire to add more, rather than—you know, more revenues rather than less.\\nSo, those are the slides that I have. And I hope that they sort of provide some sort of context, and a little bit of, you know, that we can discuss in the questions that I really look forward to answering from the audience.\\nFASKIANOS: Thank you, Carolyn. That was great.\\nSo now, we’re going to go to all of you for your questions and comments.\\n(Gives queuing instructions.)\\nAll right, so I’m going to go to the first raised hand in the thing. Amadine Hom, go to you first, and please accept the—unmute yourself.\\n(Pause.)\\nYou are still muted.\\n(Pause.)\\nOK, I don’t know—are you there? Oh, I think—OK.\\nLet’s go to Morton Holbrook.\\nQ: Yes, good afternoon.\\nDr. Kissane, what a shocking presentation—(laughs)—a hundred million barrels a day and it’s going up, notwithstanding the Paris Climate Agreement of 2015. Is that agreement simply a dead letter, or is it having any effect on oil—on fossil fuel production, particularly oil production? Or what’s the best scenario, in terms of reducing dependence on fossil fuels, considering the oil market?\\nThank you.\\nKISSANE: Well—hi, Morton, thank you so much for that excellent question.\\nYeah, that’s kind of why I emphasize that number, is because a lot of people sort of just aren’t aware of how much oil we continue to consume, and again, what the demand expectations are moving forward. And these demand expectations are, you know, coming out of forecasts from the International Energy Agency.\\nSo, I think there’s a big question as to when we see peak demand. And, you know, if you look at BP scenarios, they expect peak demand to happen, you know, before 2030, where, as, you know, others kind of contest that they—that they think that peak demand won’t happen until after 2030. I mean, again, a lot depends on, you know, what we are now experiencing in the energy transition, and how, sort of quickly are we—can we transition away from oil.\\nI think what’s really critical, when we’re looking at oil, is oftentimes we think only about the transportation sector. So we’re thinking about cars, we’re thinking about planes, you know, we’re thinking about trucks, and tankers, and all these things. But it’s petrochemicals, you know? There’s just a lot of oil that also goes into fertilizer. So, it really is across our economy, and across economies, across the global system.\\nOne of the things that I always tell my students is even during COVID, where you had many countries, right, much of the world was experiencing some level of lockdown, we did have a reduction in oil demand, but it wasn’t—it wasn’t like 20 million barrels. It was under ten.\\nSo, the fact that now it’s 2023, the world has reopened, it’s really hard to sort of see, or to know with certainty, is when we’re going to see that—see that reduction in demand.\\nNow, I think with the Paris Agreement, what’s also important is—to note is, you know, if you’re—if you’re in the oil and gas space—and I was just at a conference earlier this morning where this was a point of conversation—was, you know, what are the companies doing to reduce the emissions from production? So, how are they integrating carbon capture, sequestration, you know, how are they managing the emissions that come from the production of fossil energy—in this case that we’re talking about, oil.\\nAnd I think one of the things that—I think if you sort of follow oil markets, or a country like Saudi Arabia, they are marketing low-emission oil. Now, we could—you know, we could sort of challenge, well, what does that—you know, what does that really mean? But you are having, you know, countries that are now sort of competing to state that they have lower emitting carbon in the production—in the production of oil. And that’s a whole other interesting sort of thing to look at, in the context of the geopolitics of oil, is to kind of understand the variation across emissions, across different countries, in the production of oil.\\nSo, we are—you know, again, we are going to be going into COP-28 this fall. Again, we are not seeing—you know, and we haven’t seen a, you know, reduction in fossil energy demand. Again, lots of people are sort of, you know, hoping that we’ll start to see it sooner rather than later. But for the time being—and again, you know, to Irina’s first question, that, you know, the last fourteen months, and with, you know, with Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, it has both shown us that, you know, Europe is sort of seeking to hasten the energy transition, by building out more renewable energy, and creating more opportunities to buy electric vehicles.\\nBut there’s still big swaths of the world that, you know, are still, and have yet to move towards, you know, really reducing—and that are actually going to see higher demand moving forward, as their economies grow.\\nFASKIANOS: Thank you.\\nI’m going to take the next question from Jovana Vujanic, who is a graduate student at Lewis University: How big of an—of an impact will the decision of the Saudi energy minister to cut oil production have on the relationship between the United States and Saudi Arabia?\\nKISSANE: Love the question, thank you so much. Yeah, no, it’s a great one.\\nSo, my take is that, of course, this decision came as a bit of a surprise, and it wasn’t something that the United States, you know, wanted. But I would say that the U.S.-Saudi relationship has been very tense for the last ten years. And as part of that—there are lots of different reasons for that, but this is yet—kind of another thing that Saudi has done.\\nAnd again, I think it’s also—Saudi has taken a non-alignment policy with relation to its position on Russia and Ukraine. So, it continues to—you know, it continues to have a relationship with Russia. It also has the relationship with Ukraine. As we saw, you know, China just brokered a very significant deal between Saudi Arabia and Iran. You know, again, Saudi Arabia and Iran are two—are two important producers for China. So, China is a large importer of oil.\\nSo, if you go back to World War—the end of World War II, that’s when the United States established the oil-for-security relationship with Saudi Arabia. And as we have grown, sort of, more—I wouldn’t say independent, but our—as our own oil production has increased, especially through the shale revolution, our dependence on the Middle East and Saudi Arabia, more specifically, has shifted.\\nSo, I think we’re seeing a very different Saudi Arabia today, which I think is going to be a challenge for the United States. I think it’s going to be very interesting to see what the summer holds. Last summer, the Biden administration did tap into the U.S. strategic petroleum reserves, the largest—the largest take in the history of the reserves, which started in 1975, you know, taking 180 million barrels out, you know, not because there was massive supply disruptions. But because, you know, as the administration said, it was—you know, it was—it was—it was a war—it was a war-specific decision, because the—you know, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine was causing energy prices to skyrocket. And to cushion the American consumer, and to better cushion the, sort of, the global economy, the United States withdrew from the SPR. So I think the summer is going to be very interesting.\\nBut I think we’re going to see, definitely, much more attention in the years to come, between the United States and Saudi Arabia. It’s not the relationship of the past. This is a kind of a very new relationship.\\nThat’s a great question.\\nFASKIANOS: Thank you. Thank you, let’s go Curran Flynn, who has a raised hand.\\nQ: Hello?\\nFASKIANOS: We can hear you, but we’re getting feedback. So you might have two devices open.\\nQ: Can you hear me now?\\nFASKIANOS: Yes.\\nQ: That’s better. OK.\\nFASKIANOS: That’s better. Thank you. Thank you so much.\\nQ: So, I’m here at King Fahd University in Saudi Arabia, right next to Aramco, here with my class from international relations. And one of my students has a question, Nasser al-Nasir (ph). Here he is.\\nQ: So, thank you, Mrs. Carolyn.\\nMy question is: How could Russia’s use of alternative transportation methods, such as the East Siberian Pipeline to China, impact the U.S. market, the domestic market, and the role of the SPR, given potential insurance workarounds from Russia’s side such as ensuring Russian tankers through their RDIF fund?\\nAnd thank you to Mrs. Irina.\\nKISSANE: Thank you. And, Dr. Flynn, thank you so much for having your students join this webinar.\\nSo, I’m a little—so, the question is about the East Siberian Pipeline? Just could you—would you mind repeating it? I just want to make sure I have it—I’m clear on the question.\\nQ: So, how could Russia’s use of alternative transportation methods, such as the East Siberian Pipeline to China, impact the U.S. energy markets, I mean domestically, and the SPR, given potential insurance workarounds from Russia’s side such as ensuring Russian tankers to the RDIF fund?\\nKISSANE: Yeah, and that’s a great question.\\nYou know, I think that, you know, begs a lot of things that we could be looking at, right, in terms of, you know, Russia’s kind of ability or capacity to sort of work around, or find workarounds, to the sanctions that were imposed. And I think we’ve seen sort of new markets—so, this kind of reshaping of the energy map with oil, we see that as—kind of in technicolor, right, whereas, you know, a lot of Russian oil would go west, is now going east, you know, China, India, being takers, and of course, you know, other countries as well.\\nYou know, what will be its impact on the—on the U.S. market? I think that’s—you know, again, I do think the sanctions were sort of carefully put into place, so that there wouldn’t be massive disruptions, so we—again, you know, Russia produces over 10 million barrels a day, and about 7 million of those barrels are exported. So, you know, if we lost all of that, that would be a—you know, that would cause some very significant economic disruption globally. We already saw, you know, impacts to sort of grains, grain exports, and food security in many different parts of the world.\\nSo, you know, Russia is finding different ways. You have shadow tankers that Russia is using to move—to move its oil—as you pointed out, the East Siberian pipeline. You know, I think there’s only so much the United States can do, or—and European countries that are part of the sanctions regime, can do to curtail Russian exports of oil.\\nBut I think that—you know, I think Russia, again, has a—has a desire, and also, you know, revenue needs—they’re funding a very expensive war—that they’re finding ways to get their—to get their oil out. I think an interesting question is, you know, what does this mean in the years ahead, the lack of investment, for example, that’s going into Russian energy infrastructure, a lack of, sort of, any kind of Western investment that is—that is going in, and what that is going to mean.\\nBut again, you know, I think, to your question, I think we will see some—you know, we are seeing some impacts, right? There’s a big question as to what—you know, what the next six months to a year will look like, with regards to the reduction from OPEC, and if we were to see a deeper curtailment on Russian oil.\\nAnd you know, would the United States then tap more into the SPR? We’re now at—you know, we’re down to seven hundred thousand barrels, which, of course, is not insignificant. But we also sort of have to be, you know, judicious about how we use the SPR.\\nBut thank you for the question.\\nFASKIANOS: Thank you.\\nI’m going to take the next question from Michael—let’s see— Trevett, a Ph.D. candidate at the University of Southern Mississippi: China and other countries claim there are petroleum reserves under the South China Sea. What are your estimates of the potential amount there, and has China begun to extract any of this oil?\\nKISSANE: Michael, thank you so much. That’s a great question.\\nSo, China already is an oil producing country, so you do have oil production in China. In the South China Sea, I can’t—I can’t say exactly. I know that there have been geological tests that have shown the reserves. Again, you do have—you know, you do have territorial concerns about sort of where—is this—you know, can China—can China tap those—or seek to explore and tap those reserves, again, if there are—if there is contention over the territory in which these reserves are located?\\nSo you know, China, again—one of the things that’s very interesting about China is that China is an oil producer, but China has seen, over the last, you know, the last decade, they have seen that they have experienced peak demand. So—I mean, sorry. Peak supply. So, they are not producing as much as they used to. And so you’re seeing a year-on-year reduction in the producing capacity.\\nYou know, if you go back maybe five or six years ago, there was lots of questions about if China could kind of replicate what happened in the United States around the shale oil revolution. I think one of the big challenges for China is that, of the—you know, where the shale reserves are located, it’s not near water, lots of questions as to—and some of it—basically, some of the tests have shown that it’s—it definitely is proving harder that, you know, they cannot sort of model the same level of development that we have seen in the United States.\\nSo, yeah, no, I think in the South China Sea, again, I think we—it’s potentially possible that we might see it. I wouldn’t—I wouldn’t—I wouldn’t say it’s soon.\\nFASKIANOS: Thank you.\\nI’m taking the next question from Rob Warren at the Anglo-American University of Prague. This question also got an upvote: How do you foresee Venezuela’s role in the global oil market changing moving forward? And can it be reintegrated into the global economy?\\nKISSANE: Oh, these are all fantastic questions. Thank you all so much.\\nYeah, Venezuela is—again, you know, Venezuela has—they have the largest reserves in the world. As part of this webinar, right, you—CFR had a—kind of a primer on Venezuelan, and kind of—you know, you look at sort of where Venezuela is. And one of the biggest challenges confronting Venezuela is both its politics, but it’s also—it basically—you know, you don’t have—you don’t have international oil service providers in the country. I think the only—the only one now that the U.S.—the U.S. has sort of given a sanctions exemption to, is that of Chevron.\\nBut I think—yeah, I mean, if you were to see, you know, kind of shifts in the political regime, and you were to see more openness, then I think you could imagine, you know, Venezuela having an opportunity, or a pathway forward, to be more integrated into the global energy system, and the global oil system. You know, I think one of the big problems that Venezuela faces is that most of its infrastructure is really old at this point. And it would need a significant amount of reinvestment to get it up to a place that it could sort of meet its potential.\\nSo, you know, Venezuela is one of these countries that’s not producing as much as it could, right? It has the potential to be producing 2 million-plus more barrels per day. But you know, we’ve seen that they really have just—they went into freefall. So, I think that’s a big issue.\\nAnd another big issue, which—God, it goes back to an earlier question—is that of emissions. So, the oil that comes out of Venezuela is a very, very heavy oil. So, it’s—it has very large carbon emissions associated with the production of that oil. So, that, I think, is—again, as we—you know, think about the emissions from oil production in countries that are sort of seeking to kind of market themselves as low-emission producers, you know, Venezuela definitely will have a very hard time recouping its—where its oil sector was. Again, it has the capacity, it has the reserves. But getting that—getting that oil out of the ground right now, you have a lot of significant above-ground risks.\\nFASKIANOS: Thank you.\\nI’m going to go next to Clemente Abrokwaa. Raised hand, so please unmute yourself.\\nQ: Can you hear me, please?\\nFASKIANOS: Yes, we can.\\nQ: Thank you. Thank you so much for your—for your talk. I was also very shocked about the amount of barrels that we consume every day. (Laughs.) I didn’t know that. But anyway, I’m from Penn State University.\\nAnd my question is: You just mentioned about the above-ground, you know, effects. And—so the movement towards, like, electric vehicles and so on, how do you think it is going to affect the African continent?\\nKISSANE: Thank you.\\nQ: I am—I’m thinking, you know, the economies, and then infrastructure. It will be very difficult for them to—(laughs)—move with the rest of the world in terms of electric vehicles, and so on. I just wanted your take on that.\\nKISSANE: Thank you, Clemente. It’s an excellent question.\\nYeah, I mean, you have countries across the African continent that not only have oil reserves, but are already producing, right? Nigeria is a—is an oil-producing country, also has more capacity, but again, you have some above-ground risks. You also have the need for investment of new infrastructure.\\nI think one of the things that has been very interesting—and I think it’s getting—it’s getting more attention, as it deserves, is how Western governments are—some of—I think a challenge across Africa is that a lot of Western governments have sort of said, listen, we’re not going to invest in fossil fuels—or also, financial institutions, Western financial institutions—we’re not going to invest in fossil fuels, or new projects that are fossil-based.\\nAnd that—you know, that’s problematic when you look across the African continent, where you still don’t have, you know, 100 percent energy access. You know, the idea of the transition to electric vehicles, which is taking a very, very long time, even here across the—across developed economies—so the need for the infusion of more capital to go into, you know, across the continent of Africa for oil and gas, that’s for their economies and for their own economic growth, I think, is really, really pivotal.\\nAnd I think this is something that, you know, is being discussed across multilateral financial institutions. And also, you know, is it hypocrisy, right, for Western banks that have, you know, kind of funded the oil and gas industry, or helped to fund the oil and gas industry in the United States and many different parts of the world, and that are now sort of not allowing those funds to flow to Africa. And they have the—again, they have the—they have the resources. So you know, is it—you know, the equity of some of these decisions that are being made, I think, is one that’s—is one that’s really important.\\nAnd again, I—you know, I said earlier in this talk, is that, you know, all—most of the demand for oil is not coming from North America and from Europe. All of the demand that we’re seeing and new demand that we’re going to see, is coming from Asia, and is going to come from Africa.\\nSo again, you know, how are we going to make sure that that demand is met, again, going back to that idea of energy security, so there is—there is accessibility, so there is reliable sources of energy at affordable prices, you know, without sort of thinking about kind of a whole-of-energy approach.\\nSo, I think it’s very—it’s a very complex issue. And I think, you know, Western banks who have sort of taken very sharp positions on what they will and will not fund, when it comes to new oil and gas projects, are getting sort of challenged as to, you know, what does that mean, then, for, you know, countries across Africa that are still very much in need of more energy, not less. And again, recognizing that, you know, EVs that, again, are still—are—you know, we’re seeing adoption here in the United States and across Europe, but it’s a big, big, big adoption in China. But it’s very uneven. So how do we ensure greater energy security for the continent of Africa, I think, is a really critical question.\\nFASKIANOS: Thank you.\\nI’ll take the next question from Kyle Bales, who is a senior at Lewis University in Romeoville, Illinois: How is the war between Russia and Ukraine having an effect on the progress of the European Green Deal? Maybe you can tell us what the European—define the European Green Deal for us, Carolyn, give us the context for that.\\nKISSANE: Yes, so, again, this is another fantastic question.\\nYeah, the European Green Deal, it’s—this is—this is great. Yeah, I mean, a lot of people would say that the European Green Deal now is—that the—Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has sort of said, hey, this is why the Green Deal is so important. This is why we really need to more quickly transition to renewable energy, because look what—look what happened when we were dependent on Russia for over 30 percent of our natural gas. And look, when Russia, you know, illegally invades Ukraine and suddenly weaponizes gas, we are left very energy-insecure. It affects—it affects consumers. It affects industry across the continent.\\nSo, I think we’re seeing, not just through the Green Deal, but we’re also seeing through, sort of European green industrial policy—so in some ways, akin to what, you know, we put into effect in—this past summer, is the Inflation Reduction Act. And we’re seeing almost, kind of, this industrial competition around clean energy technologies.\\nAnd so, Europe is investing—you know, I think it’s about $250 billion, the United States, it’s about 370 billion—towards the—kind of the energy transition, and helping to support domestic industries and companies to—you know, to be able to, you know, develop the technologies, and to have the, you know, the opportunity to contribute to the energy transition.\\nSo, I think one thing, though—whenever I talk about Europe, it’s really important, is to sort of recognize that, you know, when you look across Europe, you have very different policies and kind of approaches, to sort of thinking about energy, and how quickly some countries want to transition and can transition, whereas others, you know, are probably going to experience a slower transition.\\nSo, just really interesting example, as you talked about the Green Deal, is the EU taxonomy, the green taxonomy, that went into effect in the—January of 2022. And there, you had, like, really a lot of contention between France and Germany, because France wanted to make sure that nuclear was part of the green taxonomy. Germany was opposed, right, but Germany wanted to make sure natural gas was part of the green taxonomy. So ultimately, in the end, both natural gas and nuclear—and again, this was—this predated Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. But in the EU green taxonomy, you have—you know, you have both nuclear and natural gas, in addition to other renewable energies that can make up this taxonomy, that includes specific measures towards adaptation and mitigation for climate change.\\nSo you know, I think you’re seeing this kind of—some people call it a race, a competition. You know, ideally, it’s—you know, we’re kind of working together to—because we’re all sort of going in the same direction—to, you know, support the transition, and to reduce—to reduce carbon emissions, and to bring in more, sort of, cleaner energy technologies into our system.\\nFASKIANOS: Thank you.\\nI’m going to take the next question from Dr. Laeed Zaghlami.\\nQ: Yes, good afternoon. This is Laeed—good afternoon, Irina. Good afternoon, Carolyn. I’m very pleased to be part of your program.\\nJust to—want to be back to Africa and particularly to Nigeria, how practical the two projects that Nigeria is advocating for pipelines, one from—through Algeria, and the other one to Morocco through western African countries? How practical are these pipelines to supply gas to Europe and parts of some African countries?\\nFASKIANOS: And Dr. Zaghlami, you are at Algiers University, correct?\\nQ: Indeed, Irina, yes. I am professor at University of Algiers, faculty of information and communication.\\nFASKIANOS: Thank you.\\nKISSANE: Dr. Laeed, can I—can I keep you on for just one second?\\nCan I ask you, what is the—what is the status right now? Is it—it’s planned, under construction? Where is—what is the status of those two pipelines? My understanding is that it’s—they’re proposed, but—\\nQ: Yes, well, actually in—practically, the pipeline between Algeria and Abuja, which means through Niger and so forth, is already in progress, whereas the other project, through thirteen western African countries, they are supposed to be implemented by 2047. But is it—is there any political game or something of strategic—(inaudible)—how practical, how logical, how efficiently will be for Nigeria to have two similar project(s)?\\nKISSANE: Yeah, no, it’s—again, thank you for the question. You know, pipelines, again, that’s why I wanted to show the—(laughs)—kind of the map of pipelines, is because, you know, a lot of pipelines transverse, you know, multiple countries, right? And this is—this requires not just, you know, a lot of cooperation, but it requires technically. It also can be very complex to build—to build pipelines. And when you’re talking about something like, as you—as you point out, these are, you know, crossing many countries.\\nYou know, I think one of the—again, one of the issues is whether or not—since, you know, what already is under construction, I think you can, you know, with confidence, that one will be completed. Anything that’s not yet under construction—and again, the timeline, 2047, is way out there—a lot of—a lot of uncertainty as to what the status of those projects will be moving forward, for various reasons, in terms of making sure that the investments are there.\\nSomeone I know that studies pipelines, he says, you know, until the steel is in the ground, you don’t have the pipeline, and so until you know that you’ve got that, you know, you’ve got all the OKs, and you feel that kind of security of being able to build it, and being able to provide the resources to supply it and to move it.\\nI think Algeria has been a really interesting case that hasn’t gotten enough attention, in terms of Algerian gas, that has—that has helped support Europe. Over the last years, we’ve seen an increase in Algerian gas going into Europe. Again, a lot of attention on U.S. LNG and the increase of liquefied natural gas exports into Europe, but also Algeria has been, you know, very important for helping to support European energy security, and make up for some of the losses of the—of the Russian gas. And I think we’ll see more attention on Algeria, and Algeria’s role as a—you know, as an important source of energy, especially, you know, gas, going into—going into Europe, moving forward.\\nFASKIANOS: So, I’ll take the next written question from Vincent Brooks, who is at Harvard and Diamondback Energy board of directors: How do you view the purchasing of discounted Russian oil by India, in particular relative to the purchasing by China? How are they using the oil purchased? And are you seeing more internal usage or external profit-making sales in places like Africa? And what are the implications of all of this?\\nKISSANE: Right, great. Great question. So, all of the above—(laughs)—in some ways, right? There is definitely sort of profits that are being made.\\nYou know, I was—I was talking about this last week with someone, and you know, if you sort of put your shoe—put yourself in the shoes of India, right, so, India is a—is a rapidly growing economy, 1.4 billion. You know, if you had—if you have very high energy inflation and high oil prices, that’s going to have ripples effects across the Indian economy. And so, you know, when you have a kind of opportunity to buy, you know, pretty steep discounted oil, which, you know, they had been able to buy from Russia, you know, for purposes of national security, they’ve been buying the oil.\\nAnd one of the things that’s very interesting about India is that, actually, India has been building out its refining capacity. So, a lot of that oil is both for domestic, and some of it is being sort of re-exported. But I think what we’ve seen is that they’re using that oil to also sort of enhance their capacity and capabilities as a rapidly emerging, refining power in Asia.\\nAnd we see that in some ways in China, too. So, China, even though oil demand was down in 2022, much of the oil that they were buying from Russia went into its strategic supplies, which, you know, they now have access to.\\nAnd again, I think, you know, a big question is what we’re going to see moving forward around oil demand in China. Wood Mackenzie just published a really interesting piece, kind of very bullish, on the expectations for oil demand in China, so whether or not they’re going to continue to buy, you know, Russian oil—and again, sort of taking advantage of these lower prices, you know. And I think—I think one of the things that—it’s kind of an inconvenient truth, whereas a lot of this oil trading used to happen in Europe, so European trading houses were kind of the main—the main points of Russian oil trade. A lot of that has been moved out, so, you know, Russia has found ways to kind of bypass some of the sanctions, and have set up—in some cases, they’ve set up trading houses. And some of those trading houses have been sort of set up in places that, you know, that they can sort of, again, bypass the compliance to the sanctions.\\nAnd you have some—you have some Russian oil traders that are making a lot of money—(laughs)—selling discounted oil, and then reselling it.\\nA really interesting case, a couple of months ago, was out of Malaysia. Malaysia announced—or, in the, you know—that they were—that 1.5 million barrels were produced and sold, but only—Malaysia doesn’t produce that much. So, those were Russian barrels that were sort of being sold under, sort of, the Malaysian—under the Malaysian barrel.\\nSo, again, I think China and India have, you know, have taken advantage. Some of this has, again—as I said, has been re-exported. And some of it, you know, has been re-exported through petroleum products, because China and India, you know, both are building and have refining capacity.\\nFASKIANOS: Thank you.\\nI’m going to take the next question from Bhakti Mirchandani at Columbia University: What global trajectory do you see for nuclear? The Russia-Ukraine crisis has taken some of the refining capacity offline, and nuclear has the potential to change the geopolitics of energy. And so what steps can be taken to foster nuclear energy?\\nKISSANE: Bhakti, thank you. And I was just at Columbia earlier today for the Center for Global Energy Policy’s conference.\\nYeah, nuclear is very interesting, right? So when we’re thinking about, you know, decarbonizing our energy systems, you know, nuclear plays a very important role, because it’s zero-emitting. So in certain parts of the world—China being one, Saudi Arabia—you know, you have a lot of new nuclear build. You know, in other parts of the world, you have a lot of contention about nuclear. We saw that even in Germany, which have, you know, three remaining nuclear power plants. And even in the midst of massive energy crisis over the last year, there was still sort of pushback about, no, those nuclear power plants need to be shut down, whereas you would think, OK, in light of energy insecurity, let’s keep them open.\\nSo, you know, France is an interesting country. France had planned to reduce its nuclear capacity by 50 percent. But this past year, they pivoted and they’ve said, no, we’re actually going to build out more nuclear, and we’re sort of—we’re totally scrapping that idea of reducing nuclear energy. And nuclear is very important for France’s electricity system.\\nSweden has also announced that they are going to build new nuclear, and they’re going to increase by, I think, almost 50 percent. Again, part of this is their—to meet their targets of net zero.\\nWe also see Japan. Japan, you know, the Fukushima disaster really turned Japanese—the Japanese public off of nuclear. Very, very deep opposition to restarting the nuclear power plants. But this past year, even though there’s still safety concerns on the part of the public, the public is also very concerned about energy insecurity and higher prices. So, nuclear being a domestic source of energy.\\nSo, I think when you look at, you know, net-zero pathways, I have not seen a net-zero pathway that does not include nuclear. So, here in the United States, the net-zero America project out of Princeton, very important place for nuclear. We just have a really hard time—(laughs)—building nuclear at cost, so it’s very expensive. Usually, it’s significant cost overruns. And of course, there is the—I think they have a really significant PR problem. People—there’s still a lot of concern about the safety of nuclear.\\nSo, I think to your point, it’s very, very important for decarbonizing energy systems, but you’re going to see, I think, very disjointed approaches. Some countries are going—are embracing nuclear, and other countries are sort of doubling down on their opposition, and are not going to allow nuclear to be part of the energy system.\\nFASKIANOS: We have so many questions, and we are just not going to get to them all.\\nSo, I’m going to take the next question from Christian Bonfili, who’s at Torcuato di Tella University in Argentina.\\nSo, do you think, Carolyn, that the landscape resulting from the Ukraine invasion by Russia, vis-à-vis securitization of gas and energy between Europe and Russia, could accelerate energy transition toward greener energy?\\nKISSANE: Great question.\\nI think in Europe, it is. And I think, you know, many analysts would agree that—the IEA, for example—you know, you had the, you know—how does Europe continue—you know, to enhance and achieve energy security without the dependence on Russia gas? And a lot of that is through renewable energy. You also have a lot of new attention on hydrogen, and the role that hydrogen will play.\\nI think—I think Europe is being cautious, and so they are not saying that they are going to completely move away from gas, so as earlier questions, are they getting gas from Algeria, or are they getting gas from Norway? Are they getting more gas from the United States in the form of liquefied natural gas? And then also an uncomfortable truth is they continue to get liquefied natural gas from Russia. So, we’ve seen an increase in LNG from Russia going into Europe.\\nThat said, I think all in, you are seeing that, you know, countries across Europe are saying, OK, you know, how can we enhance our energy security? How do we build more sort of domestic energy sources? Solar, wind, we’re seeing, you know, more rapid deployment. You’ve got a lot of questions about supply chains and things like that, but I think—overall, I think the answer would be that it’s quickening the energy transition.\\nFASKIANOS: So, I will take the moderator prerogative to just ask the final question for you to close on. And just to give us your top three—what are the major challenges for the geopolitics of oil, as you look out over the next five- to ten-year horizon, that you would leave us with, to be looking for?\\nKISSANE: OK. You know, so I think what we saw, right, tensions between Saudi Arabia and the United States. We also have a, you know, a hot war, cold war, depending on, you know, the term you want to use, between the United States and China, and lots of sort of questions as to what that’s going to look like.\\nI think there’s—you know, I think there’s concern that, you know, we’re not reducing demands, but we’re seeing tightening supply. And so that’s going to have, you know, very significant impacts for economies, especially economies that are already very fragile, economically fragile, politically fragile. So that concerns me a lot, in terms of, you know, what happens when, you know, economies don’t have adequate access to energy to make sure that their industries, that their—that consumers, you know, are able—that the lights can stay on, and you can get—you know, if you’re dependent on cars, you’re depending on trucks, like, all these kinds of things are really, really critical.\\nSo, I think we have to be very cautious moving forward, that we don’t take more out of the system before we have adequately set up the system to be resilient, and to be able to sort of meet the energy security demands that are not—are not—they’re not decreasing. I think they are increasing and becoming even more complex.\\nSo, I think there’s a lot of concerns and a lot of uncertainty. And you know, this definitely is going to be an area to watch in the years ahead.\\nFASKIANOS: Carolyn Kissane—Kissane, excuse me—thank you very much for shaping and sharing this discussion, for sharing your terrific insights with us, and to all of you for your questions and comments.

Yesterday, President Donald Trump was walking back his recent criticisms of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, going as far as to say he could not believe that he had called Zelensky a “dictator.” Today, Trump held an acrimonious meeting with Zelensky that culminated in Ukrainian president being asked to leave the White House and a joint press conference being canceled.\\nThe Trump-Zelensky meeting before the press pool spray, which Vice President JD Vance joined, has no precedent. Heads of government generally do not bicker in front of the cameras. But in today’s meeting, Trump accused Zelensky of “gambling with World War III,” said that Ukraine does not “have the cards” to stay in its war with Russia, and insisted that Russian President Vladimir Putin had gone “through a hell of a lot with me” because of accusations the Kremlin sought to help Trump win the 2016 election.\\nMore on:\\nUnited States\\nThe War in Ukraine\\nTrump\\nU.S. Foreign Policy Program\\nNational Security and Defense Program\\nTrump followed up on the meeting with a Truth Social post accusing Zelensky of having “disrespected the United States of America.”\\nBut the post notably also left the door open for Zelensky to get back in Trump’s good graces by saying that Ukraine “is ready for peace.”\\nZelensky certainly has every incentive to heal the spat. Shortly after departing, he tweeted out his peace offering:\\nThose words may, or may not, be enough to placate Trump. Much may turn on whether he and his advisors read Zelensky’s words as sincere—or mocking their demands that he publicly thank the United States for its support.\\nSo where do things go from here? The honest answer is that no one but Trump knows—and even he may not. Today’s outburst may have been spontaneous, or it may have been calculated. Trump’s chaotic and disruptive negotiating style, combined with his taste for performative acts meant to thrill his MAGA base and intimidate opponents, means either motivation is possible.\\nMore on:\\nUnited States\\nThe War in Ukraine\\nTrump\\nU.S. Foreign Policy Program\\nNational Security and Defense Program\\nThe Water's Edge\\nJames M.

Although he said in December that he might reduce U.S. military aid to Ukraine once in office, that has yet to happen. Ukraine’s ability to hold off Russia depends on maintaining the flow of U.S. weapons. Everything changes if that stops. Europe cannot make up the shortfall. So while the rhetorical fireworks between Trump (and Vance) and Zelensky grab the headlines—Trump himself said that today’s meeting made for “great television”—deeds matter more than words.\\nTrump no doubt believes that he came out of today’s exchange with Zelensky as the winner. But he may have complicated his effort to negotiate an end to the war in Ukraine. It has always been doubtful that Russian President Vladimir Putin will agree to any terms other than the ones he dictates. Those include, among other things , that Ukraine concede territory beyond what Russia has already taken. Trump’s rebuke of Zelensky only encourages Putin belief that he will get what he wants if he stands firm. So Trump’s public spat with Zelensky hardly seems consistent with the art of the deal.\\nTrump could, of course, follow through on his implied threat today and wash his hands of Ukraine. But that entails big political risks for his presidency. Trump may think well of Putin, but most Americans do not . Leaving Ukrainians to the mercy of Russian forces could damage Trump as much as the botched withdrawal from Afghanistan hurt President Joe Biden.\\nWhat is clear from today’s meeting is that U.S. foreign policy under Trump will not follow the path that it has for the past eighty years, as if that point needed to be proved again. The forty-seventh president remains more focused on the alleged shortcomings of America’s friends than on standing up to a predatory power that threatens U.S. interests. That is a recipe for a more dangerous world .\\nOscar Berry assisted in the preparation of this post .\\nCreative Commons\\nCreative Commons: Some rights reserved.\\nClose\\nThis work is licensed under Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0) License.\\nView License Detail\\nClose\\nExplore More\\nPost\\nThe President’s Inbox Recap: Trump’s Peace Plan for Ukraine\\nPost\\nThe President’s Inbox Recap: The Future of U.S. Foreign Policy\\nBackgrounder\\nFunding the United Nations: How Much Does the U.S. Pay?\\nCouncil on Foreign Relations\\nAbout\\nMember Programs\\nContact\\nSupport\\nFor Media\\nNewsletters\\nMembership\\nCareers\\n©2025 Council on Foreign Relations.\\nAll rights reserved.\\nPrivacy Policy and\\nTerms of Use .\\n\"},\n",

White House officials were also annoyed that Zelenskyy did not wear a suit, Trump Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said. Top Trump advisor Elon Musk has appeared at the White House wearing a t-shirt and baseball cap. U.S. President Donald Trump meets with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the White House in Washington, D.C., U.S., Feb. 28, 2025. Brian Snyder | Reuters President Donald Trump found the tone and body language of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenksyy objectionable during an Oval Office meeting that exploded into a loud argument on Friday, the White House told CNBC. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said there was not a specific thing that Zelenskyy said in the Oval Office to Trump or Vice President JD Vance that the president objected to, but the tone and manner in which he said it. Leavitt said Friday that Zelenskyy — whose country was invaded three years ago by Russia at the direction of its president, Vladimir Putin — was folding his arms, rolling his eyes and sitting in a way that indicated a lack of respect. Leavitt also pointed out that Zelenskyy called Vance \"JD,\" instead of \"Mr. Vice President,\" during the fiery exchange, which was televised in front of reporters in the Oval Office.

Trump Media sues Brazil Supreme Court justice who once crossed Musk The clash occurred when Zelenskyy challenged the idea that Russia could be trusted to honor the terms of any peace deal that would be reached through diplomacy. Vance then accused the Ukrainian leader of being \"disrespectful\" by \"trying to litigate\" the terms of such a deal in the Oval Office. Press secretary Leavitt said that White House officials were also annoyed that Zelenskyy did not wear a suit during his visit Friday, which abruptly ended with a scheduled news conference and meal both canceled after the Oval Office blow-up. When CNBC noted that the White House did not appear to have a problem with top Trump advisor Elon Musk recently appearing in the Oval Office next to the president wearing a t-shirt and a baseball cap, Leavitt said that was different because the billionaire Tesla CEO is not the leader of a \"sovereign nation.\" Elon Musk and President Donald Trump in the Oval Office at the White House, Feb. 11, 2025.

Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia — asked Zelenskyy, \"Why don\\'t you wear a suit?\" \"You\\'re at the highest level in this country\\'s office, and you refuse to wear a suit,\" Glenn pressed. \"Do you own a suit?\" Zelenskyy, who was dressed in a black sweater bearing the national symbol of Ukraine, shot back: \"I will wear a suit after this war is over.\" \"Maybe something like yours,\" Zelenskyy told Glenn. \"Maybe better.\" watch now VIDEO 3:05 03:05 Trump: Zelenskyy disrespected the U.S., can come back when he is ready for peace Power Lunch During the Oval Office meeting, Vice President Vance argued that Zelenskyy should \"thank\" Trump for the aid the U.S. has given Ukraine to defend itself against Russia. Zelenskyy responded that he had expressed thanks \"a lot of times. Even today.\" Trump, at one point, defended Russia\\'s Putin againsr Zelenskyy, saying, \"\\u200aPutin went through a hell of a lot with me.\" \"He went through a phony witch hunt where they used him and Russia, Russia, Russia, Russia. You ever hear of that deal?\" Trump asked, referring to the wide-ranging investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. Trump was impeached in 2019 by the U.S. House of Representatives on charges of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress over a July 2019 phone call to Zelenskyy in which he pressured the Ukrainian president to open an investigation into the business dealings of Hunter Biden and his father, former President Joe Biden , who at the time had emerged as a key rival to Trump\\'s chances of winning re-election in 2020. Trump also had conditioned the release of nearly $400 million in U.S. military and security aid to Ukraine on Zelenskky publicly announcing a probe into the Bidens and another probe into \"a discredited theory promoted by Russia alleging that Ukraine — rather than Russia — interfered in the 2016 president election,\" according to the articles of impeachment. Trump was acquitted after a trial in the Senate. watch now VIDEO 2:08 02:08 Trump to Zelenskyy: \\'You\\'re gambling with World War III\\' Halftime Report Subscribe to CNBC PRO Subscribe to Investing Club Licensing & Reprints CNBC Councils Select Personal Finance CNBC on Peacock Join the CNBC Panel Supply Chain Values Select Shopping Closed Captioning Digital Products News Releases Internships Corrections About CNBC Ad Choices Site Map Podcasts Careers Help Contact News Tips Got a confidential news tip?

Archive VF Shop Magazine DIPLOMACY DEBACLE Trump and Vance’s Oval Office Clash With Zelensky Devolves Into Diplomacy Debacle Following a disastrous meeting at the White House on Friday, Ukraine's president is meeting with European leaders in London about a possible peace agreement between Moscow and Kyiv. By Katie Herchenroeder March 1, 2025 US President Donald Trump (C) and Vice President JD Vance meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in the Oval Office at the White House on February 28, 2025 in Washington, DC. Andrew Harnik/Getty Images Save this story Save Save this story Save From the moment Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky walked toward President Donald Trump outside of the White House on Friday, the mood was tense . After a brief “How are you,” Trump immediately commented on what Zelensky, who was donning black pants and a matching military shirt, was wearing. “Oh, you’re all dressed up,” Trump said sarcastically as the two leaders shook hands. Whatever cordialness the pair had previously maintained quickly devolved over the next couple of hours in an Oval Office meeting that further strained relations between Trump and Vice President JD Vance and Zelensky into further disarray. The government heads, along with some foreign policy staffers and reporters, were meeting to discuss a new agreement on rare earth minerals. Upstairs in the East Room, the White House staff had set up a long wooden table for the leaders to sign—but they never got there.

In a frustrated response, Zelensky outlined the ceasefires Russia had broken in the past, going back a decade. “What kind of diplomacy, JD, you are speaking about?” he asked. “I’m talking about the kind of diplomacy that’s going to end the destruction of your country,” Vance said back, sitting on a sofa with Trump to his right in a chair. “I think it’s disrespectful for you to come into the Oval Office to try to litigate this in front of the American media,” he continued, one of multiple times he gestured to reporters in the room. The group of pool reporters in the Oval Office was hand-picked by the Trump administration, their latest move in restricting which media outlets have close access to the president. “You should be thanking the president,” Vance said. The vice president and Zelensky continued their back and forth before Trump interjected—leading to an increasingly loud overlapping of voices in the Oval Office as people reportedly watched on in disbelief. “You don’t have the cards right now, with us you start having cards” Trump said, chastising the Ukrainian president for not being more thankful to the United States, and him personally, for sending aid. “I’m not playing cards,” Zelensky responded. “I’m a president in war.” Vance then went in again, also accusing Zelensky of not being thankful enough. “Please, you think if you will speak very loudly about the war—” Zelensky began, before Trump cut him off, saying, “he’s not speaking loudly.” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky speaks during an interview with Fox News Chief Political Anchor Bret Baier on Special Report With Bret Baier at the Fox News studios on February 28, 2025 in Washington, DC.\\nWin McNamee/Getty Images What came next sounded more like one of Trump’s rallies on the campaign trail and less like a meeting to mitigate any future harm in a war that has already killed or wounded roughly one million Russians and Ukrainians. At one point, a journalist asked what would happen if Russian President Vladimir Putin broke a ceasefire deal agreed upon by Russia, Ukraine, and the United States. “What if anything, what if a bomb drops on your head right now,” Trump responded. In another moment, Trump began rambling about a Hunter Biden - Joe Biden - Hillary Clinton - Adam Schiff “witch hunt” and “scam” against himself and Putin as Zelensky listened on, visibly confused and furrowing his brow. In addition to reprimanding Zelensky for not being thankful or “nice” enough, the president also claimed he wasn’t a “tough guy,” a charge that uniquely highlighted Friday’s show of masculinity by Trump and Vance. “The problem is,” Trump began, “I’ve empowered you to be a tough guy, and I don’t think you’d be a tough guy without the United States.” “And your people are very brave,” he said. Zelensky agreed to that part. “But,” Trump continued, “you’re either going to make a deal or we’re out, and if we’re out, you’ll fight it out. I don’t think it’s going to be pretty.” US President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky meet in the Oval Office at the White House on February 28, 2025 in Washington, DC.\\nAndrew Harnik/Getty Images The meeting on Friday comes after Trump previously called Zelensky a dictator, and the Ukrainian president claimed that Trump is living in a Russian “disinformation bubble.” (When Trump was asked later about referring to Zelensky as a “dictator,” he said, “Did I say that? I can’t believe I said that.) After the men eventually left the conversation, with no agreement signed and relations tenser than before, Trump unilaterally decided that Zelensky was “not in a place to negotiate,” according to a White House official, and directed Secretary of State Marco Rubio and national security adviser Mike Waltz to deliver a message to the Ukrainians in the White House: It was time for Zelensky to leave. In the hours following, leaders from across Europe defended Zelensky, with French President Emmanuel Macron distinguishing between who he called the “aggressor,” Russia, and the “victim, Ukraine. Many Republican leaders, meanwhile, rallied behind Trump. Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina—who has been one of the most vocal Republicans in support of Ukraine and who posed for a picture with Zelensky and fellow congress members before the Oval Office meeting—quickly changed his tune, telling reporters later on Friday, “I have never been more proud of the president. I was very proud of J.D. Vance standing up for our country.” X content This content can also be viewed on the site it originates from. Later on Friday, Zelensky spoke with Fox News’ Bret Baier , thanking Trump, Congress, and the American people for aiding Ukraine’s efforts against Russia. “You helped us a lot. From the very beginning, during three years of full-scale invasion, you helped us to survive,” he said. “We are thankful and sorry for this,” Zelensky continued, mentioning the meeting, “I mean this, we wanted very much to have strong relations.” He stopped short, though, of saying sorry directly to Trump when Baier asked him if he owed Trump an apology. When Baier asked if Zelensky believed that his relationship with Trump could be salvaged, the Ukrainian leader responded, “Yes, of course.” According to CNN , Trump watched the interview on his presidential aircraft.
